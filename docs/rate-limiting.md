# Rate Limiting

`Benzene.RateLimiting` adds best-effort request rate limiting to any Benzene pipeline, built on
.NET's standard [`System.Threading.RateLimiting`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.ratelimiting)
abstractions. Its job is **protection**: endpoints a service can't avoid exposing publicly — health
checks, the [spec endpoint](spec.md) — should not be a free denial-of-service vector, or, on
serverless plans that scale on demand, a way for a stranger to run up your bill.

## Read this first: it limits per instance

The limiter lives inside one service instance. Run three instances behind a load balancer and you
admit up to **3× the configured rate**; let a serverless platform scale out under load and the
multiplier grows with it — the very scale-out an attacker triggers weakens the brake. That makes
this deliberately *not* an exact science:

- **Authoritative rate limiting belongs at the gateway** — API Gateway usage plans, Azure API
  Management policies, your ingress/WAF — where one limit covers every instance.
- Use this package as **defense-in-depth**: a cheap floor of protection for endpoints that would
  otherwise ship with none, and for deployments that don't have a gateway in front of them yet.

## Quick start

Add the middleware **before** whatever it should protect:

```csharp
app.UseBenzeneMessage(x => x
    .UseFixedWindowRateLimiting(60, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1))   // 60 requests/minute
    .UseHealthCheck()
    .UseSpec()
    .UseMessageHandlers());
```

A message over the limit never reaches the protected middleware: it short-circuits with a
`too-many-requests` result, which the standard status mapping serves as **HTTP 429**, with the
limiter's retry-after hint in the error message when the limiter provides one:

```json
{ "status": "too-many-requests", "errors": ["Rate limit exceeded; retry after 42s"] }
```

Nothing is ever queued — a protective limiter that queues requests just moves the resource
exhaustion into memory — so rejection is immediate.

## Limiting by payload size

Request *count* isn't always the right unit: a spec endpoint costs roughly the same per hit, but a
message-accepting endpoint can be abused with a few enormous payloads as effectively as with many
small ones. `UsePayloadSizeRateLimiting` runs a token bucket where **each message costs its request
body's size in UTF-8 bytes** (a bodyless message costs 1) — a bytes-per-second budget:

```csharp
.UsePayloadSizeRateLimiting(
    maxBurstBytes: 256 * 1024,          // bucket size: the most admissible at once
    bytesPerPeriod: 64 * 1024,          // sustained rate: 64 KiB/second
    replenishmentPeriod: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
```

A single payload larger than `maxBurstBytes` can never be granted and is always rejected.

## Bring your own limiter

Every built-in above is sugar over the same seam: any `System.Threading.RateLimiting.RateLimiter`
plugs in — sliding window, concurrency, a `PartitionedRateLimiter` wrapped to a single partition,
or your own subclass — with an optional per-message permit cost:

```csharp
.UseRateLimiting(new SlidingWindowRateLimiter(new SlidingWindowRateLimiterOptions
{
    PermitLimit = 100,
    Window = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
    SegmentsPerWindow = 5,
    QueueLimit = 0,
}))

// or with a custom cost per message:
.UseRateLimiting(myLimiter, (resolver, context) => CostOf(context))
```

The limiter instance is shared across every message on the pipeline for the process lifetime — the
caller owns its disposal. Concurrency-style limiters work correctly: the acquired lease is held
across the rest of the pipeline and released when the message completes.
