# Benzene 1.0.0 API Surface Review

**Date:** 2026-07-08
**Reviewer:** Claude (Automated Review)
**Goal:** Identify public APIs that are stable enough to commit to for 1.0.0 release with semver guarantees

> **2026-07-14 audit pass** — re-verified every "Must Fix (Blocking)" item and both named bugs against
> current code (this review is now 6 days old; a great deal of work has landed since, verified here
> rather than trusted from other docs' own claims). Status:
> 1. **ToDelete folder — ✅ resolved.** No longer exists; `IMessageResult`/`IHasMessageResult` live
>    directly in `Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers` (confirmed today, and XML-documented as part
>    of this same audit pass — see `work/ToDelete-refactoring-plan.md`).
> 2. **Test helpers in production packages — ✅ resolved.** All 4 files this review named
>    (`Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers/BenzeneMessage/TestHelpers/*`, `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Kafka/TestHelpers/*`,
>    `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway/BenzeneTestHostExtensions.cs`,
>    `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway/MessageBuilderExtensions.cs`) are gone from their production
>    packages — moved into sibling `.TestHelpers` packages. A repo-wide sweep today additionally found
>    and fixed 3 more instances of the same problem this review didn't catch (in
>    `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Core` and `Benzene.Azure.Function.Core`, both outside this review's original
>    10-package scope) — see `work/test-helpers-refactoring-plan.md`.
> 3. **Both named bugs — ✅ fixed.** `BenzeneServiceContainerExtensions.cs`'s `TryAddSingleton(Type,Type)`
>    correctly calls `AddSingleton` now (not `AddScoped`); `Extensions.cs`'s `Split` correctly captures
>    `newApp` in its closure (not `app`). Both verified by reading the current source directly.
> 4. **XML documentation — ✅ now complete for all 10 packages this review covers.** All 5 packages
>    marked "READY FOR 1.0 AFTER adding XML docs" (`Benzene.Abstractions`, `.Abstractions.Middleware`,
>    `Benzene.Core`, `Core.Middleware`, `Benzene.Http`) plus the 3 AWS packages are confirmed at 0
>    CS1591 warnings on a clean rebuild (`Benzene.Core.Middleware` had 5 real gaps —
>    `BenzeneApplicationBuilder`, added later by the cross-platform startup unification and never
>    documented — fixed in this pass). The two packages this review marked "NEEDS WORK"
>    (`Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers`: 47 types/37 files; `Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers`: 60+
>    types/66 files) were fully documented via two parallel background passes as part of this audit,
>    both independently re-verified by a fresh clean rebuild (0 CS1591, 0 CS1574) and full test suite
>    (713 passed, 4 skipped, matching baseline exactly — docs-only, no behavior change). Both `.csproj`
>    files now have `GenerateDocumentationFile=true` for ongoing compiler enforcement.
> 5. **New bug found and fixed while documenting `MessageRouter<TContext>`: missing `await` on
>    `IMessageHandlerResultSetter.SetResultAsync` in 4 call sites** (`src/Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers/MessageRouter.cs`).
>    `MessageRouter` is the terminal middleware for message-handler dispatch on every transport
>    (`.UseMessageHandlers()`), and `SetResultAsync`'s job is to actually write the outbound
>    response/result (confirmed: `ResponseMessageMessageHandlerResultSetterBase.SetResultAsync` awaits
>    an `IResponseHandlerContainer.HandleAsync` call that builds status/headers/body). Firing it
>    without `await` meant the pipeline could return before the response was fully written whenever a
>    response handler did genuine async I/O, and any exception thrown inside it would go unobserved
>    instead of surfacing. The same pattern (found via a repo-wide grep for
>    `_messageHandlerResultSetter.SetResultAsync(` calls not preceded by `await`) existed in 3 more
>    places, all fixed the same way: `src/Benzene.JsonSchema/JsonSchemaMiddleware.cs` (2 call sites),
>    `src/Benzene.Kafka.Core/Kafka/KafkaMessageContextConverter.cs` (returned `Task.CompletedTask`
>    while the real work ran unobserved — changed to return the actual task), and
>    `src/Benzene.Http/Cors/CorsMiddleware.cs` (the call was inside a `private void` helper — made it
>    `async Task` and awaited it from `HandleAsync`). Verified via full solution build (0 errors) and
>    full test suite (713 passed, 4 skipped) after the fix — not a behavior change under test, since
>    the existing tests apparently don't exercise a genuinely-async response handler, which is exactly
>    how this went unnoticed; worth a maintainer follow-up to add a test that would have caught it
>    (e.g. a response handler with an artificial `await Task.Yield()` to force non-synchronous
>    completion).
> 6. **Not attempted in this pass** (genuine judgment calls, not mechanical fixes — left for a
>    maintainer decision, consistent with how this session has handled every other breaking-API-shaped
>    question): reducing public API surface (marking implementation details `internal`), the naming
>    issues (double "Message" in names, file/class mismatches, "Builder" vs "Build" inconsistency), and
>    the 1.0 release-strategy recommendation (Option A/B/C) itself. Those remain open exactly as this
>    review originally framed them. Two more filename/classname mismatches were newly found while
>    documenting (beyond the ones this review already knew about): `BenzeneMessage/BenzeneBodyMapper.cs`
>    actually defines `BenzeneMessageGetter`, and root `BenzeneMessageContext.cs` actually defines
>    `MessageHandlerContext<TRequest, TResponse>` (the real `BenzeneMessageContext` lives in
>    `Benzene.Core.Messages`) — both noted in `<remarks>` on the affected types rather than renamed.
>
> **2026-07-14, later the same day — follow-up pass verifying this review against current `src/`**
> (the pass above predates both items below; re-verified by reading actual current source, not by
> trusting this document's own narrative):
> 7. **CORS brought to full `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors` parity.** `CorsSettings`
>    (`src/Benzene.Http/Cors/CorsSettings.cs`) gained three new public properties —
>    `ExposedHeaders`, `AllowCredentials`, `MaxAgeSeconds` — and `CorsOriginChecker.MatchOrigin`
>    (`src/Benzene.Http/Cors/CorsMiddleware.cs`) now matches exact scheme+host+port when an
>    `AllowedDomains` entry is a full URL (previously host-only for every entry, full URL or not);
>    `AllowedHeaders` now also accepts a `"*"` wildcard, echoing back the actual requested headers
>    (an `AllowAnyHeader()` equivalent, since a literal `"*"` isn't honored by browsers on
>    credentialed requests). These are pure additions — no existing member changed shape — but
>    they're exactly the kind of new public surface this document exists to catalog before 1.0
>    locks semver. Section 7 (`Benzene.Http`) below has been updated accordingly. Independently
>    corroborated by `work/azure-roadmap-1.0.md`'s own 2026-07-14 "CORS, SDK-consistency, and
>    code-quality follow-up" entry, which describes the same work from the Azure side.
> 8. **Logging abstraction the original 2026-07-14 audit pass (above) missed entirely:**
>    `IBenzeneLogger`, `IBenzeneLogContext`, `IBenzeneLogAppender`, and `BenzeneLogLevel` no longer
>    exist anywhere in `src/` — grepping the full source tree (excluding build artifacts) for all
>    four names returns zero matches. Commit `3f3b25d` ("Replace IBenzeneLogger stack with
>    Microsoft.Extensions.Logging", **2026-07-12** — two days before even this document's original
>    audit pass) deleted the whole custom logging stack in favor of plain
>    `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger<T>` throughout the framework (e.g.
>    `MessageRouter<TContext>` now takes an `ILogger<MessageRouter<TContext>>`). This document's
>    Section 1 (`Benzene.Abstractions`) and Section 4 (`Benzene.Core`) still listed the deleted
>    types as current public surface as of this morning's audit pass; both are corrected below.
>    Independently corroborated by `work/observability-roadmap-1.0.md`, which documents the same
>    commit and additionally notes it made three provider-adapter packages
>    (`Benzene.Microsoft.Logging`, `Benzene.Serilog`, `Benzene.Log4Net`) redundant and they were
>    deleted too. Since this is a removal of previously-public types (not an addition), it is the
>    single most significant finding of this follow-up pass for a document whose purpose is
>    cataloging the public surface before 1.0 semver lock — flagged prominently rather than buried
>    in a bullet list.

## Executive Summary

This review examined 10 core packages intended for the 1.0.0 release. The analysis reveals:

- **READY FOR 1.0:** Benzene.Abstractions, Benzene.Abstractions.Middleware, Benzene.Core, Benzene.Core.Middleware, Benzene.Http
- **NEEDS WORK BEFORE 1.0:** Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers, Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers (documentation gaps, experimental features)
- **RECOMMEND STAYING PREVIEW:** Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Kafka (newer adapter, less mature)
- **BORDERLINE 1.0:** Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Core, Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway (stable but AWS-specific, consider 1.0 with caution)

---

## Package-by-Package Analysis

### 1. Benzene.Abstractions ✅ READY FOR 1.0

**Public API Surface:**
- **DI abstractions:** `IBenzeneServiceContainer`, `IServiceResolver`, `IServiceResolverFactory`, `IDependencyInjectionAdapter<T>`, `IRegisterDependency`
- **Logging:** ~~`IBenzeneLogger`, `IBenzeneLogContext`, `IBenzeneLogAppender`, `BenzeneLogLevel` (enum)`~~
  **removed 2026-07-12** (commit `3f3b25d`) — replaced by plain `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger<T>`
  throughout the framework; see the 2026-07-14 follow-up note at top. Only `ILogContextBuilder<T>`
  remains from the original logging surface.
- **Serialization:** `ISerializer`
- **Results:** `IBenzeneResult`, `IBenzeneResult<T>`, `Void` class
- **Builders:** `IHttpBuilder<T>`, `IMessageBuilder<T>`, `IBenzeneTestHost`
- **Other:** `ICorrelationId`, `IDependencyWrapper<T>`

**Strengths:**
- Core abstractions are simple, well-scoped, and unlikely to need breaking changes
- DI abstraction layer is clean and mature
- Result types follow common patterns

**Concerns:**

1. ~~**Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL for 1.0~~ **✅ resolved** — see 2026-07-14 audit-pass
   note at top (0 CS1591 warnings on a clean rebuild); spot-checked directly for this follow-up
   pass too — `IBenzeneServiceContainer.cs` alone now carries 46 `<summary>`-tagged doc comments.
   Also note: `IBenzeneLogger.cs` below no longer exists at all (see point 8 of the 2026-07-14
   follow-up note at top — the whole `IBenzeneLogger` stack was deleted 2026-07-12).
   - File: `IBenzeneServiceContainer.cs:1` - No XML docs on any method
   - File: `IServiceResolver.cs:1` - No XML docs
   - ~~File: `IBenzeneLogger.cs:1` - No XML docs~~ (file deleted 2026-07-12, see above)
   - File: `ISerializer.cs:1` - No XML docs
   - **ALL public interfaces lack XML documentation**

2. **Naming inconsistency:**
   - File: `BenzeneServiceContainerExtensions.cs:120` - Bug: `TryAddSingleton(Type)` calls `AddScoped` instead of `AddSingleton`
   - File: `BenzeneServiceContainerExtensions.cs:46` - Method `AddScoped<T>(T implementation)` should probably be named `TryAddScoped` based on implementation logic

3. **Potential API surface issues:**
   - `Void` class (Results/Void.cs:3) - Consider using `System.Void` or a struct instead of class for better semantics
   - `IHttpBuilder<T>` and `IMessageBuilder<T>` - Purpose unclear without documentation

**Recommendation:** READY FOR 1.0 AFTER:
1. ✅ Adding comprehensive XML documentation to all public types — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top
2. ✅ Fixing the bug at BenzeneServiceContainerExtensions.cs:120 — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top
   (verified: `TryAddSingleton(Type, Type)` now calls `AddSingleton` correctly)
3. 🔸 Clarifying naming of AddScoped vs TryAddScoped at line 46 — still open, maintainer call

---

### 2. Benzene.Abstractions.Middleware ✅ READY FOR 1.0

**Public API Surface:**
- `IMiddleware<TContext>` - Core middleware interface
- `IMiddlewarePipeline<TContext>` - Pipeline execution
- `IMiddlewarePipelineBuilder<TContext>` - Fluent builder
- `IMiddlewareApplication<TEvent>` and `IMiddlewareApplication<TRequest, TResponse>` - Application entry points
- `IEntryPointMiddlewareApplication` (marker), `IEntryPointMiddlewareApplication<TEvent>`, `IEntryPointMiddlewareApplication<TEvent, TResult>`
- `IMiddlewareFactory` - Factory abstraction
- `IMiddlewareWrapper` - Wrapper abstraction
- `IContextConverter<TIn, TOut>` - Context transformation
- `IContextPredicate<TContext>` - Conditional routing

**Strengths:**
- Clean, focused interface design
- Follows standard middleware patterns
- Generic design is flexible without being over-engineered

**Concerns:**

1. ~~**Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL~~ **✅ resolved** — see 2026-07-14 audit-pass note
   at top; spot-checked directly — `IMiddleware.cs` now has 6 `<summary>`-tagged doc comments.
   - File: `IMiddleware.cs:1` - No XML docs
   - File: `IMiddlewarePipelineBuilder.cs:1` - No XML docs
   - All interfaces lack documentation

2. **API clarity:**
   - File: `IEntryPointMiddlewareApplication.cs:3` - Empty marker interface purpose unclear without docs
   - File: `IMiddlewareWrapper.cs:5` - Interface has no members, purpose unclear

3. **Generic constraints:**
   - `IMiddleware<in TContext>` uses contravariant `in` - this is correct but should be documented why

**Recommendation:** ✅ READY FOR 1.0 — XML documentation added, see 2026-07-14 note at top

---

### 3. Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers ⚠️ NEEDS WORK

**Public API Surface (47 public types):**
- **Core handlers:** `IMessageHandler`, `IMessageHandler<TRequest>`, `IMessageHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `IMessageHandlerBase<TRequest, TResponse>`
- **Handler infrastructure:** `IMessageHandlerFactory`, `IMessageHandlersList`, `IMessageHandlersFinder`, `IMessageHandlerDefinition`, `IMessageHandlerDefinitionLookUp`
- **Context:** `IMessageHandlerContext<TRequest, TResponse>`, `IBenzeneMessageContext` (empty interface)
- **Results:** `IMessageHandlerResult`, `IMessageHandlerResult<TResponse>`, `IMessageHandlerResultBase`
- **Pipelines:** `IHandlerPipelineBuilder`, `IHandlerMiddlewareBuilder`, `IPipelineMessageHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`
- **Request mapping:** `IRequestMapper<TContext>`, `IRequestMapBuilder<TContext>`, `IRequestEnricher<TContext>`, `IRequestContext<TRequest>`, `ISerializerOption<TContext>`
- **Response handling:** `IResponseHandler<TContext>`, `IAsyncResponseHandler<TContext>`, `ISyncResponseHandler<TContext>`, `IResponseHandlerContainer<TContext>`, `IBenzeneResponseAdapter<TContext>`, `IResponsePayloadMapper<TContext>`
- **Routing:** `IMessageRouterBuilder`, `IVersionSelector`
- **Message extraction:** `IMessageGetter<TContext>`, `IMessageTopicGetter<TContext>`
- **Transport info:** `ITransportsInfo`, `ITransportInfo`, `ICurrentTransport`, `ISetCurrentTransport`, `IApplicationInfo`
- **Legacy/ToDelete:** `IMessageResult`, `IHasMessageResult` in ToDelete folder
- **Other:** `IRequestMapperThunk`, `IMessageHandlerWrapper`, `IMessageHandlerResultSetter<TContext>`

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive handler infrastructure
- Good separation of concerns between request, response, and routing

**Concerns:**

1. **ToDelete folder in public API** - BLOCKING for 1.0
   - File: `ToDelete/IMessageResult.cs:3` - Public interface in "ToDelete" folder
   - File: `ToDelete/IHasMessageResult.cs:3` - Public interface in "ToDelete" folder
   - **Action required:** Delete or move these before 1.0

2. **Empty/marker interfaces without documentation:**
   - File: `IBenzeneMessageContext.cs:7` - `IMessageHandlerContext<TRequest, TResponse>` needs docs
   - Purpose of many interfaces unclear without documentation

3. **API complexity:**
   - 47 public types is a LOT for one package
   - Consider if some of these should be internal
   - `IMessageHandlerBase<TRequest, TResponse>` - unclear why this is separate from `IMessageHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`

4. **Inconsistent naming:**
   - `IRequestMapBuilder` vs `IMiddlewarePipelineBuilder` - inconsistent use of "Build" vs "Builder"
   - `IMessageTopicGetter` vs `IMessageGetter` - "Getter" suffix inconsistency

5. **Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL
   - No XML docs found on any interface

6. **Type name concerns:**
   - `IRequestMapperThunk` - "Thunk" is developer jargon, consider renaming
   - `IMessageHandlerResultSetter` - "Setter" implies mutation, is this the right abstraction?

**Recommendation:** NOT READY FOR 1.0 UNTIL:
1. ✅ Remove or relocate everything in ToDelete folder — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top
2. ✅ Add comprehensive XML documentation — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top (also
   documents the `IMessageHandlerBase`/`IMessageHandler` distinction and clarifies
   `IRequestMapperThunk`'s role in-place rather than renaming it)
3. 🔸 Consider reducing API surface by making some types internal — still open, maintainer call
4. 🔸 Rename confusing types like `IRequestMapperThunk` — still open, maintainer call (now documented instead)
5. ✅ Document the distinction between `IMessageHandlerBase` and `IMessageHandler` — done

---

### 4. Benzene.Core ✅ READY FOR 1.0

**Public API Surface:**
- **Logging:** ~~`BenzeneLogger`, `NullBenzeneLogger`, `NullBenzeneLogContext`, `NullDisposable`~~
  **removed 2026-07-12** (commit `3f3b25d`, same removal as `Benzene.Abstractions`'s `IBenzeneLogger`
  stack — see the 2026-07-14 follow-up note at top). What remains: `LogContextBuilder<TContext>`,
  `ContextDictionaryBuilder<TContext>`, `IContextDictionaryBuilder<TContext>`
- **DI:** `IRegistrations`, `IRegistrationCheck`, `RegistrationCheck`, `RegistrationsBase`, `RegistrationRecorder`, `RegistrationMatch`
- **Exceptions:** `BenzeneException`
- **Utilities:** Various extension methods in `ContextDictionaryBuilderExtensions` (this review's
  original "`LogContextExtensions`" name doesn't match any current type — corrected here),
  `DictionaryUtils`, `Utils`. Note `LoggerExtensions` (the `UseLogResult` middleware extension) has
  since moved to `Benzene.Core.Middleware`, not this package.
- **Constants:** `Constants` class

**Strengths:**
- Concrete implementations of core abstractions
- Good null object pattern usage
- Utilities are generally helpful

**Concerns:**

1. ~~**Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL~~ **✅ resolved** — see 2026-07-14 audit-pass note at
   top; spot-checked directly — `Constants.cs` and `Helper/Utils.cs` each now carry 8 `<summary>`-tagged
   doc comments.
   - No XML docs on any public type

2. **Naming concerns:**
   - File: `Helper/Utils.cs` - Generic "Utils" class name is too vague
   - File: `Helper/DictionaryUtils.cs` - Consider more specific naming

3. **API design questions:**
   - File: `DI/RegistrationRecorder.cs:7` - Purpose unclear without docs
   - File: `Logging/IContextDictionaryBuilder.cs:7` - Generic name, needs docs to clarify purpose

4. **Constants class:**
   - File: `Constants.cs` - What constants? Need to review actual content

**Recommendation:** READY FOR 1.0 AFTER:
1. ✅ Adding XML documentation — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top
2. 🔸 Reviewing and potentially renaming vague utility classes — still open, maintainer call

---

### 5. Benzene.Core.Middleware ✅ READY FOR 1.0

**Public API Surface:**
- **Pipeline:** `MiddlewarePipeline<TContext>`, `MiddlewarePipelineBuilder<TContext>`
- **Applications:** `MiddlewareApplication<TEvent, TContext, TResult>`, `MiddlewareApplication<TEvent, TContext>`, `MiddlewareMultiApplication<TEvent, TContext, TResult>`, `MiddlewareMultiApplication<TEvent, TContext>`, `EntryPointMiddlewareApplication<TEvent>`, `EntryPointMiddlewareApplication<TEvent, TResult>`
- **Middleware:** `FuncWrapperMiddleware<TContext>`, `ContextConverterMiddleware<TContext, TContextOut>`
- **Factory:** `DefaultMiddlewareFactory`
- **Null implementations:** `NullBenzeneServiceContainer`, `NullServiceResolver`, `NullServiceResolverFactory`
- **Other:** `RegisterDependency`, `InlineContextConverter<TIn, TOut>`
- **Router:** `MiddlewareRouter` (found in grep results)
- **Extensions:** Rich set of extension methods in `Extensions.cs` (Use, OnRequest, OnResponse, Split, Convert methods)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive middleware pipeline implementation
- Excellent extension method API for fluent configuration
- Good separation between abstractions and implementations
- Null object pattern implementations

**Concerns:**

1. ~~**Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL~~ **✅ resolved** — see 2026-07-14 audit-pass note at
   top; spot-checked directly — `Extensions.cs` now carries 48 `<summary>`-tagged doc comments.
   - File: `Extensions.cs:6` - 20+ extension methods with no XML docs
   - No XML docs on any public type

2. ~~**Extension method concerns:**~~ **✅ bug fixed** — see 2026-07-14 audit-pass note at top;
   verified directly: the `Split` overloads now read `await newApp.Build().HandleAsync(...)`, not `app`.
   - File: `Extensions.cs:151-168` - `Split` method has a bug: line 174 calls `builder(app)` instead of `builder(newApp)`
   - Multiple overloads might be confusing without good documentation

3. **Naming:**
   - `FuncWrapperMiddleware` - "Wrapper" might be misleading, it's more of an adapter
   - `MiddlewareMultiApplication` - "Multi" is vague

4. **API surface:**
   - `InlineContextConverter` - Is this meant to be public or is it an implementation detail?

**Recommendation:** READY FOR 1.0 AFTER:
1. ✅ Adding comprehensive XML documentation, especially for extension methods — done, see
   2026-07-14 note at top
2. ✅ Fixing the bug in Split method at line 174 — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top
3. 🔸 Consider renaming `MiddlewareMultiApplication` to something clearer — still open, maintainer call

---

### 6. Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers ⚠️ NEEDS WORK

**Public API Surface (60+ public types):**
- **Core handlers:** `MessageHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `PipelineMessageHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `MessageHandlerNoResultWrapper<TRequest, TResponse>`, `PipelineMessageHandlerWrapper`
- **Results:** `MessageHandlerResult`, `MessageHandlerResult<TResponse>`, `MessageResult`, `IMessageResult`, `DefaultStatuses`, `IDefaultStatuses`
- **Infrastructure:** `MessageHandlerFactory`, `MessageHandlerMiddleware<TRequest, TResponse>`, `MessageHandlersList`, `MessageHandlerDefinition`, `MessageHandlerDefinitionLookUp`
- **Routing:** `MessageRouter<TContext>`, `MessageRouterBuilder`, `HandlerPipelineBuilder`, `VersionSelector`
- **Finders:** `ReflectionMessageHandlersFinder`, `DependencyMessageHandlersFinder`, `CacheMessageHandlersFinder`, `CompositeMessageHandlersFinder`
- **Request mapping:** `RequestMapper<TContext>`, `MultiSerializerOptionsRequestMapper<TContext, TDefaultSerializer>`, `JsonDefaultMultiSerializerOptionsRequestMapper<TContext>`, `EnrichingRequestMapper<TContext>`, `SerializerOptionBase`, `RequestMapperThunk<TContext>`
- **Response handling:** `ResponseHandler<T, TContext>`, `ResponseHandlerContainer<TContext>`, `ResponseBodyHandler<TContext>`, `DefaultResponsePayloadMapper<TContext>`, `ResponseIfHandledMessageHandlerResultSetter<TContext>`, `ResponseMessageMessageHandlerResultSetterBase<TContext>`, `DefaultResponseStatusHandler<TContext>`, `MessageMessageHandlerResultSetterBase` (base class)
- **Serialization:** `JsonSerializer`, `PayloadSerializer`, `BodySerializer<TContext>`, `IBodySerializer`, `ISerializationResponseHandler<TContext>`, `JsonSerializationResponseHandler<TContext>`
- **BenzeneMessage:** `BenzeneMessageApplication`, `BenzeneMessageGetter`, `BenzeneMessageMessageHandlerResultSetter`, `BenzeneMessageResponseAdapter`, `BenzeneBodyMapper`, `DefaultResponseStatusHandler<TContext>`
- **Context:** `MessageHandlerContext<TRequest, TResponse>`, `BenzeneMessageContext`
- **Info:** `ApplicationInfo`, `BlankApplicationInfo`, `TransportInfo`, `TransportsInfo`, `CurrentTransportInfo`, `TransportMiddlewarePipeline<TContext>`
- **Filters:** `IFilter<T>`, `FiltersMiddleware<TRequest, TResponse>`, `FiltersMiddlewareBuilder`
- **Attributes:** `MessageAttribute`
- **Registrations:** `CoreRegistrations`
- **Utilities:** `MessageGetter<TContext>`, various extensions
- **Test helpers:** `BenzeneTestHostExtensions`, `MessageBuilderExtensions` in test folders

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive message handling implementation
- Good separation of concerns
- Flexible serialization support
- Filter infrastructure

**Concerns:**

1. **CRITICAL: Test helpers in production package**
   - File: `BenzeneMessage/TestHelpers/BenzeneTestHostExtensions.cs` - Test helpers should NOT be in production packages
   - File: `BenzeneMessage/TestHelpers/MessageBuilderExtensions.cs` - Should be in separate test package
   - **Action required:** Move to Benzene.Testing or mark as internal

2. **Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL
   - No XML docs on any of the 60+ public types
   - Especially important given the complexity

3. **Naming concerns:**
   - `MessageMessageHandlerResultSetterBase` - Double "Message" in name
   - `DefaultResponseStatusHandler` vs `DefaultStatuses` - Inconsistent naming
   - `BenzeneBodyMapper` - Actually named `BenzeneMessageGetter` in code (BenzeneBodyMapper.cs:8)

4. **API surface is very large:**
   - 60+ public types in one package
   - Many types seem like implementation details that could be internal
   - Examples: `CacheMessageHandlersFinder`, `CompositeMessageHandlersFinder`, `RequestMapperThunk<TContext>`

5. **Legacy/deprecated code:**
   - File: `MessageResult.cs:12` - `MessageResult` and `IMessageResult` - relationship to ToDelete folder unclear

6. **Serialization concerns:**
   - File: `Serialization/JsonSerializer.cs:6` - Hardcoded to System.Text.Json, should be documented
   - File: `Serialization/PayloadSerializer.cs` - Purpose unclear without docs

7. **Extension methods:**
   - File: `Extensions.cs` - Many extension methods, some with complex logic
   - File: `MessageMapperExtensions.cs` - Need documentation

8. **Base class concerns:**
   - `ResponseMessageMessageHandlerResultSetterBase<TContext>` - Very long name with "Message" twice
   - `DefaultMessageMessageHandlerResultSetterBase` - Also has "Message" twice

**Recommendation:** NOT READY FOR 1.0 UNTIL:
1. ✅ Move test helpers to separate package or mark internal — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top
2. ✅ Add comprehensive XML documentation — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top; also caught
   and fixed a real bug in the process (missing `await` on `SetResultAsync` in
   `MessageRouter<TContext>` — see point 5 in the 2026-07-14 note)
3. 🔸 Significantly reduce public API surface by marking implementation details as internal — still open, maintainer call
4. 🔸 Fix naming issues (double "Message", inconsistent conventions) — still open, maintainer
   call; the "double Message" names are now explicitly documented as intentional (not typos)
   rather than renamed, and 2 more filename/classname mismatches were found (`BenzeneBodyMapper.cs`
   defines `BenzeneMessageGetter`; root `BenzeneMessageContext.cs` defines `MessageHandlerContext<,>`)
5. 🔸 Document serialization dependencies — partially done (XML docs now note the
   `System.Text.Json` dependency on `JsonSerializer`); a dedicated docs page is still open
6. 🔸 Consider splitting into multiple packages — still open, maintainer call

---

### 7. Benzene.Http ✅ BORDERLINE 1.0

**Public API Surface:**
- **Context:** `IHttpContext`, `HttpRequest`
- **Adapters:** `IHttpRequestAdapter<TContext>`
- **Routing:** `IHttpEndpointDefinition`, `IHttpEndpointFinder`, `IListHttpEndpointFinder`, `IRouteFinder`, `HttpEndpointDefinition`, `HttpTopicRoute`, `UrlMatcher`, `RouteFinder`
- **Routing implementations:** `ReflectionHttpEndpointFinder`, `CacheHttpEndpointFinder`, `CompositeHttpEndpointFinder`, `DependencyHttpEndpointFinder`, `ListHttpEndpointFinder`
- **Status codes:** `IHttpStatusCodeMapper`, `DefaultHttpStatusCodeMapper`, `HttpStatusCodeResponseHandler<TContext>`
- **Headers:** `IHttpHeaderMappings`, `HttpHeaderMappings`, `DefaultHttpHeaderMappings`
- **CORS:** `CorsSettings`, `CorsMiddleware<TContext>`, `CorsOriginChecker` — **grew later on
  2026-07-14** (after this morning's audit pass; see point 7 of the 2026-07-14 follow-up note at
  top): `CorsSettings` gained three new public properties, `ExposedHeaders`, `AllowCredentials`,
  and `MaxAgeSeconds`, bringing it to full `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors` parity. This is new public
  surface added since this document's own audit pass and needs to be tracked before 1.0 semver locks.
- **Attributes:** `HttpEndpointAttribute`
- **Registrations:** `HttpRegistrations`
- **Extensions:** Extension methods in `Extensions.cs`, `Cors/Extensions.cs`

**Strengths:**
- Clean HTTP abstraction layer
- Good routing infrastructure
- CORS support built-in
- Flexible adapter pattern

**Concerns:**

1. ~~**Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL~~ **✅ resolved** — see 2026-07-14 audit-pass note at
   top; spot-checked directly — `HttpRequest.cs` now carries 8 `<summary>`-tagged doc comments, and
   `CorsSettings.cs`/`CorsMiddleware.cs` (including the 3 new CORS properties, see above) are fully
   documented too.
   - No XML docs on any public type

2. **Naming issues:**
   - File: `Routing/ListMessageHandlerFinder.cs:4` - Class is named `ListHttpEndpointFinder` but file is named `ListMessageHandlerFinder` - confusing (re-verified 2026-07-14, still unchanged)
   - `HttpTopicRoute` - "Topic" seems like messaging terminology in HTTP context

3. **CORS implementation:**
   - File: `Cors/CorsMiddleware.cs:93` - `CorsOriginChecker` is public but seems like implementation detail
   - ~~CORS middleware might need more configuration options for production use~~ **✅ largely
     addressed 2026-07-14** — `CorsSettings` now also exposes `ExposedHeaders`, `AllowCredentials`,
     and `MaxAgeSeconds`, and `CorsOriginChecker` now matches exact scheme+host+port (not just host)
     when an `AllowedDomains` entry is a full URL, plus `AllowedHeaders` supports a `"*"` wildcard.
     This is full parity with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors`'s configuration surface; see point 7 of
     the 2026-07-14 follow-up note at top.

4. **API design questions:**
   - File: `HttpRequest.cs:3` - Simple class, does it need to be public or should it be internal?
   - File: `UrlMatcher.cs:5` - Is this meant to be used directly or is it implementation detail?

5. **Status code mapping:**
   - File: `DefaultHttpStatusCodeMapper.cs:5` - Implementation details not documented, what's the default mapping?

**Recommendation:** READY FOR 1.0 AFTER:
1. ✅ Adding comprehensive XML documentation — done, see 2026-07-14 note at top
2. 🔸 Fixing filename/classname mismatch (`ListMessageHandlerFinder.cs` defines
   `ListHttpEndpointFinder`) — still open, re-verified 2026-07-14, unchanged
3. 🔸 Reviewing what should be public vs internal (especially CorsOriginChecker, UrlMatcher) — still
   open, maintainer call
4. ✅ Documenting CORS configuration options and limitations — done via XML docs on `CorsSettings`;
   also note the configuration surface itself grew (see CORS bullet above) — this document's own
   "might need more configuration options" concern is now largely satisfied

### 8. Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Core ⚠️ BORDERLINE 1.0

**Public API Surface:**
- **Entry points:** `IAwsLambdaEntryPoint`, `AwsLambdaEntryPoint`, `IAwsEntryPointBuilder`, `InlineAwsLambdaStartUp`, `AwsLambdaStartUp` (base class implied)
- **Router:** `AwsLambdaMiddlewareRouter` (generic base, inferred from subclasses)
- **Context:** `AwsEventStreamContext`
- **BenzeneMessage:** `BenzeneMessageLambdaHandler` (also called `DirectMessageLambdaHandler` in file)
- **Registrations:** `AwsRegistrations`
- **Extensions:** `LogContextBuilderExtensions`, `BenzeneMessage/Extensions.cs`

**Strengths:**
- Clean AWS Lambda integration
- Good abstraction over Lambda entry points
- Startup configuration pattern

**Concerns:**

1. **Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL
   - No XML docs on any public type

2. **Naming confusion:**
   - File: `BenzeneMessage/DirectMessageLambdaHandler.cs:10` - Class named `BenzeneMessageLambdaHandler` but file is `DirectMessageLambdaHandler`
   - Inconsistent naming between class and file

3. **AWS-specific concerns:**
   - Package depends on AWS SDK versions - need to document supported versions
   - Breaking changes in AWS SDK could force breaking changes here

4. **Generic router:**
   - `AwsLambdaMiddlewareRouter` is referenced but implementation not visible - need to verify it's properly public

5. **Entry point design:**
   - File: `AwsLambdaEntryPoint.cs:11` - Implements IDisposable, disposal semantics need documentation
   - Startup lifecycle not documented

**Recommendation:** BORDERLINE 1.0 - Consider keeping at preview or 1.0 with caveats:
1. Add comprehensive XML documentation
2. Fix naming inconsistencies
3. Document AWS SDK version dependencies and compatibility
4. Document disposal and lifecycle semantics
5. Consider keeping at 0.x until AWS SDK dependencies are stable

---

### 9. Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Kafka ❌ RECOMMEND PREVIEW

**Public API Surface:**
- **Application:** `KafkaApplication`
- **Handler:** `KafkaLambdaHandler`
- **Context:** `KafkaContext`
- **Message extraction:** `KafkaMessageBodyGetter`, `KafkaMessageHeadersGetter`, `KafkaMessageTopicGetter`
- **Result handling:** `KafkaMessageMessageHandlerResultSetter`
- **Registrations:** `KafkaRegistrations`
- **Extensions:** `Extensions.cs`, `DependencyInjectionExtensions.cs`, `TestHelpers/MessageBuilderExtensions.cs`

**Strengths:**
- Follows established Benzene patterns
- Clean integration with Kafka

**Concerns:**

1. **Test helpers in production** - CRITICAL
   - File: `TestHelpers/MessageBuilderExtensions.cs` - Test helpers should be in separate package

2. **Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL
   - No XML docs on any public type

3. **Kafka-specific concerns:**
   - Kafka support is newer/less mature than HTTP/API Gateway
   - Depends on AWS Kafka event structure which could change
   - Error handling for Kafka-specific scenarios not evident

4. **API maturity:**
   - Smaller API surface than ApiGateway package
   - Less battle-tested in production (assumption based on relative complexity)

5. **Context design:**
   - File: `KafkaContext.cs:6` - Implements `IHasMessageResult` from ToDelete folder - RED FLAG

6. **Naming:**
   - `KafkaMessageMessageHandlerResultSetter` - "Message" appears twice

**Recommendation:** KEEP AT PREVIEW (0.x) because:
1. Uses interfaces from ToDelete folder
2. Test helpers mixed into production code
3. Newer adapter with less production validation
4. AWS Kafka events API may evolve
5. Consider 1.0 after 6+ months of production usage

---

### 10. Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway ⚠️ BORDERLINE 1.0

**Public API Surface:**
- **Application:** `ApiGatewayApplication`
- **Handler:** `ApiGatewayLambdaHandler`
- **Context:** `ApiGatewayContext` (implements `IHttpContext`)
- **Adapter:** `ApiGatewayHttpRequestAdapter`, `ApiGatewayResponseAdapter`
- **Message extraction:** `ApiGatewayMessageBodyGetter`, `ApiGatewayMessageHeadersGetter`, `ApiGatewayMessageTopicGetter`
- **Request enrichment:** `ApiGatewayRequestEnricher`
- **Result handling:** `ApiGatewayMessageMessageHandlerResultSetter`
- **Custom Authorizer:** `ApiGatewayCustomAuthorizerApplication`, `ApiGatewayCustomAuthorizerLambdaHandler`, `ApiGatewayCustomAuthorizerContext`
- **CORS:** `ApiGatewayContextCorsMiddleware`, `Cors/Extensions.cs`
- **Registrations:** `ApiGatewayRegistrations`
- **Extensions:** `Extensions.cs`, `DependencyInjectionExtensions.cs`, `MessageBuilderExtensions.cs`, `BenzeneTestHostExtensions.cs`, `LogContextBuilderExtensions.cs`
- **Constants:** `Constants` class

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive API Gateway integration
- Good HTTP context mapping
- Custom authorizer support
- CORS middleware for API Gateway
- More mature than Kafka adapter

**Concerns:**

1. **Test helpers in production** - BLOCKING
   - File: `BenzeneTestHostExtensions.cs` - Test helper in production package
   - File: `MessageBuilderExtensions.cs` - Test helper in production package

2. **Missing XML documentation** - CRITICAL
   - No XML docs on any public type

3. **Naming issues:**
   - `ApiGatewayMessageMessageHandlerResultSetter` - "Message" appears twice
   - File naming vs class naming consistency

4. **API Gateway version concerns:**
   - Depends on AWS API Gateway event structures (v1 vs v2)
   - Not clear which version is supported
   - Breaking changes in AWS event format would require breaking changes

5. **Custom Authorizer concerns:**
   - File: `ApiGatewayCustomAuthorizer/Extensions.cs` - Custom authorizer is complex, needs docs
   - Policy generation not evident - critical for authorizers

6. **Constants:**
   - File: `Constants.cs` - What constants? Need to verify they're appropriate for public API

**Recommendation:** BORDERLINE 1.0 - Can be 1.0 AFTER:
1. Moving test helpers to separate package or marking internal
2. Adding comprehensive XML documentation
3. Documenting API Gateway version support (v1 vs v2)
4. Documenting custom authorizer policy requirements
5. Fixing double "Message" in naming
6. Consider keeping at preview until AWS event formats stabilize

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 1. XML Documentation - CRITICAL BLOCKER

**Finding:** ZERO XML documentation found across ALL packages

**Impact:**
- Users won't get IntelliSense help
- API purpose and usage unclear
- Major blocker for professional library adoption

**Action Required:**
Every public type, method, property must have XML docs before 1.0. Minimum required:
- `<summary>` for all public members
- `<param>` for all parameters
- `<returns>` for all methods with return values
- `<remarks>` for complex behaviors
- `<example>` for key entry points

### 2. Test Helpers in Production Packages - BLOCKING

**Finding:** Test helper methods in production packages

**Files:**
- `Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers/BenzeneMessage/TestHelpers/`
- `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Kafka/TestHelpers/`
- `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway/BenzeneTestHostExtensions.cs`
- `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway/MessageBuilderExtensions.cs`

**Action Required:**
Move to `Benzene.Testing` package or mark as internal. Test helpers should NEVER be in production packages.

### 3. ToDelete Folder - BLOCKING

**Finding:** Public interfaces in folder named "ToDelete"

**Files:**
- `Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers/ToDelete/IMessageResult.cs`
- `Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers/ToDelete/IHasMessageResult.cs`

**Impact:**
- `KafkaContext` implements `IHasMessageResult` from ToDelete folder
- Unclear migration path

**Action Required:**
Delete these interfaces and refactor any usage, or move out of ToDelete folder if still needed.

### 4. Naming Consistency

**Issues Found:**
- Double "Message" in names: `MessageMessageHandlerResultSetter`, `ApiGatewayMessageMessageHandlerResultSetter`, etc.
- File names don't match class names: `DirectMessageLambdaHandler.cs` contains `BenzeneMessageLambdaHandler`
- Inconsistent suffixes: "Builder" vs "Build", "Getter" vs "Get"
- Generic utility names: `Utils`, `Extensions`

**Action Required:**
Establish and enforce naming conventions before 1.0.

### 5. API Surface Size

**Finding:** Some packages expose too much as public

**Specific concerns:**
- `Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers` - 60+ public types
- `Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers` - 47 public types
- Many implementation details are public (e.g., `CacheMessageHandlersFinder`, `UrlMatcher`)

**Action Required:**
Review each public type and mark as `internal` if it's an implementation detail.

### 6. Bug Found

**Critical bugs that would be breaking changes after 1.0:**

1. File: `Benzene.Abstractions/DI/BenzeneServiceContainerExtensions.cs:120`
   - Method `TryAddSingleton(Type)` calls `AddScoped` instead of `AddSingleton`
   - **MUST FIX before 1.0**

2. File: `Benzene.Core.Middleware/Extensions.cs:174`
   - `Split` method calls `builder(app)` instead of `builder(newApp)`
   - **MUST FIX before 1.0**

### 7. Serialization Dependencies

**Finding:** Hard dependencies on specific serializers not documented

**Files:**
- `Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers/Serialization/JsonSerializer.cs` - Uses System.Text.Json

**Action Required:**
Document serialization dependencies and consider making them pluggable.

---

## Recommendations by Package

### ✅ Ready for 1.0.0 (after fixes)
1. **Benzene.Abstractions** - Add XML docs, fix bug at line 120
2. **Benzene.Abstractions.Middleware** - Add XML docs
3. **Benzene.Core** - Add XML docs
4. **Benzene.Core.Middleware** - Add XML docs, fix Split bug
5. **Benzene.Http** - Add XML docs, review public API surface

### ⚠️ Needs Work Before 1.0
6. **Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers** - Fix ToDelete folder, add docs, reduce API surface
7. **Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers** - Move test helpers, add docs, reduce API surface, fix naming

### 🔄 Keep at Preview (0.x)
8. **Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Kafka** - Uses ToDelete interfaces, test helpers, newer/less mature

### 🤔 Borderline (your call)
9. **Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Core** - AWS dependency concerns, add docs
10. **Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway** - Move test helpers, add docs, AWS version concerns

---

## 1.0 Release Strategy Recommendations

### Option A: Conservative (Recommended)
**Ship at 1.0:**
- Benzene.Abstractions
- Benzene.Abstractions.Middleware
- Benzene.Core
- Benzene.Core.Middleware
- Benzene.Http

**Keep at 0.x preview:**
- Benzene.Abstractions.MessageHandlers (0.9.x)
- Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers (0.9.x)
- Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Core (0.9.x)
- Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway (0.9.x)
- Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Kafka (0.5.x - newer)

**Timeline:**
- Immediate: Ship core + middleware at 1.0
- 3-6 months: Promote message handlers to 1.0 after cleanup
- 6-12 months: Promote AWS packages after production validation

### Option B: Aggressive (Not Recommended)
Ship everything at 1.0 simultaneously - high risk due to ToDelete folder issues and test helper pollution.

### Option C: Moderate
Ship core + message handlers at 1.0, keep AWS adapters at preview.

---

## Critical Path to 1.0

### Must Fix (Blocking)
1. ✅ Delete or relocate ToDelete folder contents — verified 2026-07-14, folder gone,
   interfaces relocated and documented
2. ✅ Move test helpers out of production packages — verified 2026-07-14; also found and
   fixed 3 more instances beyond this review's original 4 (see 2026-07-14 note above)
3. ✅ Fix bugs in BenzeneServiceContainerExtensions.cs:120 and Extensions.cs:174 — verified
   2026-07-14, both read correctly in current source
4. ✅ Add XML documentation to all public APIs — genuinely true as of 2026-07-14 for all
   10 packages this review covers (0 CS1591 warnings on a clean rebuild, verified for
   each package individually); see the 2026-07-14 note at the top of this document

### Should Fix (Strongly Recommended)
5. 🔸 Reduce public API surface by marking implementation details as internal
6. 🔸 Fix naming issues (double "Message", file/class mismatches)
7. 🔸 Document AWS SDK version dependencies
8. 🔸 Document serialization dependencies

### Nice to Have
9. ➕ Split large packages into smaller ones
10. ➕ Add more examples to XML docs
11. ➕ Create migration guide from alpha to 1.0

---

## Estimated Effort

**To ship Option A (core packages only):**
- Documentation: 20-30 hours
- Bug fixes: 2-4 hours
- Testing: 8-10 hours
- **Total: ~30-45 hours**

**To ship all packages at 1.0:**
- Additional cleanup: 40-60 hours
- Additional documentation: 40-50 hours
- Additional testing: 20-30 hours
- **Total: ~130-190 hours**

---

## Conclusion

Benzene has a solid foundation, but significant work is needed before a 1.0 release:

1. **Critical blockers:** ToDelete folder, test helpers in production, missing docs, bugs
2. **Strong recommendation:** Ship core packages at 1.0, keep message handlers and AWS at preview
3. **Timeline:** With focused effort, core packages could be 1.0-ready in 2-3 weeks

The conservative approach (Option A) gives users stable core functionality while allowing more time to mature the message handling and AWS integration layers.
