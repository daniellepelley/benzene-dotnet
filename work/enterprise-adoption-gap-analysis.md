# Benzene — Enterprise Adoption Gap Analysis

**Status:** DRAFT for review — a decision-oriented backlog, not a commitment
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-17
**Purpose:** Identify the *features* Benzene needs for enterprise adoption by reasoning about a
representative enterprise system's requirements and finding where Benzene struggles. Deliberately
**not** about "more battle-hardening" or "more downloads" — every item is a buildable capability,
**or** a deliberate decision that it is *not* Benzene's job.

**Guiding principle (from review 2026-07-17):** Do not reinvent the wheel. Benzene should own
**cross-cutting concerns that live in the shared pipeline** and **reliability primitives its
transport model demands** — and stay out of **database access** and **domain-level** concerns,
which belong to the application inside the running process. A capability only belongs in Benzene
if it (a) fits the middleware/hexagonal model, (b) leverages the uniform topic+payload message
shape, or (c) adds genuine multi-cloud abstraction value. Otherwise it's a documented pattern the
user builds with existing extension points, or it's out of scope entirely.

**Method:** Every claim was checked against the codebase (package list, `src/**`) at the date
above, not assumed. Where an item says "absent" or "already partly there", it was verified by
inspection.

**Read alongside:** [`benzene-vision.md`](benzene-vision.md) — items are scored against its five
design tests (§2).

---

## 1. The reference enterprise system

Anchor on **Benzene's own origin** (see `benzene-vision.md` §1): a **multi-tenant B2B SaaS serving
thousands of businesses**, event-driven, multi-cloud. Its non-negotiables:

1. **Strict tenant isolation** — no cross-tenant data/config/load bleed.
2. **Fine-grained authorization** — "may *this* principal do *this* action on *this* resource".
3. **Reliable async processing** — at-least-once transports must not lose or double-apply events;
   multi-step distributed operations must not leave orphaned records on partial failure.
4. **Auditability & compliance** — who did what; PII handled to policy.
5. **Operational governance** — secrets out of config, safe config change, per-tenant quotas.

## 2. What Benzene already has (so we don't rebuild it)

- **Transport-agnostic handlers + one middleware pipeline** across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions,
  Azure self-hosted (Service Bus / Event Hub), Google Cloud, gRPC, ASP.NET Core, and self-hosted
  workers (Kafka / HTTP). This is the moat — most "gaps" are one middleware away *because* of it.
- **Scoped per-message state seam** — `PresetTopicHolder` + `PresetTopicMiddleware` demonstrate the
  canonical pattern: a scoped holder set by a middleware, read downstream, `null` when a pipeline
  doesn't opt in, never coupled to the transport context. **This is the seam tenancy (and similar
  cross-cutting state) reuses.**
- **Authentication**: `Benzene.Auth.OAuth2` (JWT/JWKS bearer), `Benzene.Auth.Basic`, `.Core`.
- **Authorization**: **scope-only** (`ScopeClaims` + `RequireScope`). No roles/policies/permissions.
- **Validation / serialization / content negotiation**: FluentValidation, DataAnnotations, JsonSchema;
  Json, Newtonsoft, Avro, MessagePack, Xml; `AddMediaFormatNegotiation`.
- **Caching**: `Benzene.Cache.Core` + `.Redis`.
- **Resilience**: `Benzene.Resilience` — **retry only** (`RetryMiddleware`).
- **Observability**: `Benzene.OpenTelemetry`, `Benzene.Diagnostics`, correlation IDs, W3C
  trace-context propagation on outbound `Clients`.
- **Health / ops**: `Benzene.HealthChecks` (+ EntityFramework, Http), `Benzene.Clients.HealthChecks`
  (consumer-side contract-drift check on the `contracts` topic), k8s probes (`Benzene.CloudService.Probe`).
- **Outbound / integration**: `Benzene.Clients` (+ `.Aws`, `Client.Http`), mid-redesign
  (`benzene-clients-redesign-plan.md`).
- **Service visibility & contracts**: `Benzene.Mesh.*` — catalog, topology, **contract-drift**;
  `MeshManifest`/`MeshManifestEntry` (provider contract + `ContractDrift` flag); a `"schema"`
  health check exposing a contract `hashCode`; and consumer-side `ClientHealthCheckProcessor` /
  `ClientHashMatch` that compares a downstream service's hash against the hash a client was built
  with. **This is a half-built contract-testing substrate.**
- **API/spec/versioning**: `Benzene.Core.Versioning`, `Benzene.Schema.OpenApi`, `Benzene.Spec.Ui`,
  CORS.
- **Codegen / DX**: Terraform, OpenAPI, Client SDKs, templates, source generators.

---

## 3. Category A — Build it (on-model, first-class)

### A.1 — Sagas / distributed rollback (`Benzene.Saga`) ★ top priority

- **Requirement.** Multi-step distributed operations (each step calling another service) must either
  fully complete or fully roll back, leaving no orphaned records, and then be safely retryable.
- **Production precedent (this is proven on Benzene).** The production system used exactly this: a
  user-signup process fanned out to many lenders as Benzene-style services in **stages**, tasks
  within a stage running in **parallel**. Stage 1 creates a tenant + a company in Okta; stage 2
  uses the returned tenant ID to create a user in a microservice; stage 3 uses that user ID to
  create an RBAC role and related identity items. If **any** call fails, the saga runs a **take-down
  strategy per stage** — a compensation function handed the created record's ID that deletes it —
  rolling the whole operation back to its starting state, after which the entire process can be
  retried. Proved very reliable and orphan-free.
- **Current state.** None; Benzene is stateless-handler-shaped.
- **The gap.** No orchestration for staged, compensating, retryable distributed transactions.
- **Proposed work.** A saga package built **on the uniform topic+payload model**: a saga definition
  of ordered **stages**; each stage a set of **parallel tasks**; each task pairs a forward action
  (a message send via `Benzene.Clients`) with a **compensation** keyed by the ID(s) the forward
  action produced; a saga runner that executes stages in order, and on any failure runs
  compensations in reverse (per stage) to restore the starting state; idempotent, retry-safe state
  tracking of what completed. Because Benzene messages are uniform, wrapping this around them is
  natural — the runner speaks topic+payload, not bespoke per-step glue.
- **Vision fit.** Strong — leverages the uniform message shape and the outbound Clients path;
  orchestration logic stays generic, compensation logic stays in the app. (Supersedes the earlier
  "integrate an external orchestrator instead of building one" note — production experience shows a
  Benzene-native saga around uniform messages is the right call.)
- **Open design questions.** Where saga state lives (pluggable store, no DB opinion baked in);
  parallel-task failure semantics (fail-fast vs. await-all-then-compensate); retry/backoff of the
  whole saga vs. individual stages; timeout/heartbeat for long-running sagas.

### A.2 — Contract testing / breaking-change gate (extend `Benzene.Mesh` + `Benzene.Clients.HealthChecks`)

- **Requirement.** Catch a provider's breaking contract change **before** it reaches an environment
  a consumer depends on.
- **Current state (already half-there).** Providers expose a contract `hashCode` via a `"schema"`
  health check and a `MeshManifestEntry.ContractDrift` flag; consumers already compare a
  downstream hash against their built-in expectation (`ClientHealthCheckProcessor` → `ClientHashMatch`).
  This now has a first-class runtime surface: `ClientHealthCheck` + `AddContractCheck<TClient>(serviceName)`
  (`Benzene.Clients.HealthChecks`) on a dedicated **`contracts`** topic (`UseContractsCheck`), which
  monitoring/the mesh scrape — kept off the liveness/readiness probes. But it remains **runtime-only**
  (surfaces as a health-check warning) and **coarse** (whole-spec hash → can't tell breaking from additive).
- **The gap.** No build/CI-time check; no breaking-vs-non-breaking discrimination; consumer
  expectations aren't captured as CI artifacts.
- **Proposed work.** Capture each consumer's expected provider contracts (topics + hashes/specs)
  as an artifact; a CI check that compares them against providers' published `MeshManifest`/OpenAPI
  and **fails on breaking changes** (removed/renamed topic, incompatible payload) while allowing
  additive ones. Reuse the existing hashing + manifest + health-check plumbing rather than adding a
  Pact-style parallel system.
- **Vision fit.** Pure Benzene infrastructure reuse; no wheel reinvention.

### A.3 — Idempotency / exactly-once effect (`Benzene.Idempotency`)

- **Requirement.** A redelivered message (the norm on SQS/Service Bus/Event Hubs/Kafka) must not
  apply its effect twice.
- **Current state.** **Shipped** (`Benzene.Idempotency`). `IdempotencyMiddleware<TContext>` derives a
  key (default: `idempotency-key` header, else a deterministic SHA-256 of topic+body — swap via
  `IIdempotencyKeyStrategy<TContext>`), atomically claims it in a pluggable `IIdempotencyStore`, and
  invokes the handler only on the first sighting. Duplicates of a completed key short-circuit and
  replay a successful result so the transport acks them. A handler that throws or reports failure
  releases the claim so the redelivery reprocesses — a transient failure is never permanently
  swallowed. `InMemoryIdempotencyStore` ships as the single-instance/test default; a shared store
  (worked Redis `SET NX` example in the cookbook) is a three-method implementation. 20 unit tests.
- **Original proposal.** Idempotency-key middleware (key from a header/property or a deterministic
  topic+body hash) + a **pluggable** store contract; ship a Redis adapter over the existing
  `Benzene.Cache.Redis`, leave DynamoDb/SQL to the user. Duplicate keys short-circuit and replay the
  recorded outcome. **No bespoke DB layer** — Benzene owns the middleware + contract, not storage.
  (Delivered as designed; the Redis adapter is documented as a copy-paste `IIdempotencyStore` rather
  than a separate package, since the cache abstraction doesn't expose the atomic `SET NX` the claim
  needs and there is no Redis in CI to integration-test a shipped adapter.)
- **Vision fit.** Cross-cutting → shared pipeline; transport-agnostic reliability primitive.
- **Docs.** `src/Benzene.Idempotency/CLAUDE.md`; cookbook `docs/cookbooks/idempotency.md`.

### A.4 — Authorization depth (extend `Benzene.Auth`)

- **Requirement.** Roles, policies, and resource/attribute checks — over any authenticated caller.
- **Current state.** **Shipped** (`Benzene.Auth.Core`, no new NuGet — BCL-only, reads a plain
  `ClaimsPrincipal`). Three mechanism-agnostic pipeline checks in `AuthorizationExtensions`, mirroring
  `RequireScope`'s shape: `RequireRole` (any-of, honoring `IsInRole` + `ClaimTypes.Role`/`role`/`roles`
  incl. Azure AD's JSON-array app-roles), `RequirePolicy` (an `IAuthorizationPolicy` instance, a
  DI-registered policy by name, or an inline sync/async predicate), and `RequireAuthorization<TResource>`
  (resource-based via an app-registered `IAuthorizationHandler<TResource>`). Each yields `Unauthorized`
  with no caller and `Forbidden` when authenticated-but-unpermitted. 8 tests (real Kestrel host after
  `UseOAuth2Bearer`).
- **Original proposal.** A policy/permission enforcement layer: `[RequirePermission]`/`[RequirePolicy]`
  handler attributes, role-claim support, and a resource-based hook
  (`IAuthorizationHandler<TResource>`), all transport-agnostic. Benzene owns the **enforcement
  mechanism**; what a permission *means* is the app's pluggable policy handler (keeps domain out).
  (Delivered as *pipeline* middleware, not per-handler attributes — consistent with the existing
  `RequireScope`/`CorsMiddleware` precedent; Benzene has no attribute-driven authorization seam, and
  `IFilter<T>` can only express "ignored", not `Forbidden`. Per-handler differentiation is done by
  composing per-route pipelines, as the auth-patterns cookbook's "Protecting Only Some Routes" shows.
  A per-handler `[RequirePolicy]` attribute remains a possible fast-follow.)
- **Vision fit.** Cross-cutting → shared pipeline.
- **Docs.** `src/Benzene.Auth.Core/CLAUDE.md`; cookbook section in `docs/cookbooks/auth-patterns.md`.

### A.5 — Secrets & multi-cloud configuration (`Benzene.Configuration.*`)

- **Requirement.** Secrets never in plaintext config; typed config validated at startup; portable
  across clouds.
- **Current state.** **Shipped** (`Benzene.Configuration.Core`, BCL-only, no new NuGet). Neutral
  one-method `ISecretStore` seam covering secrets and config; BCL providers (`InMemory`,
  `EnvironmentVariable` with name→key mapping, `File` for Docker/K8s mounts, `Composite` first-non-null
  layering, `Caching` = the optional-reload seam with TTL + `Invalidate`); `SecretResolver`
  (typed fail-fast `Require*`/`Get`) and `SecretValidation.EnsureRequiredAsync` (startup completeness,
  lists all missing at once); `AddSecretStore(s)` DI. 17 tests. Cloud adapters (Key Vault, Secrets
  Manager, SSM) are a one-method implementation each, documented copy-paste in the cookbook.
- **Original proposal.** A **neutral secrets/config abstraction** with provider adapters for Azure Key
  Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, SSM Parameter Store, and Azure App Configuration; startup
  fail-fast validation; optional reload. The value is the multi-cloud abstraction (a portability
  win, on-vision) — not re-implementing any provider.
  (Delivered abstraction-first per an explicit scope decision: the core ships BCL-only, and the cloud
  adapters are documented copy-paste implementations rather than SDK-dependency packages — each cloud
  SDK is a new NuGet dep AGENTS.md gates, and none can be CI-integration-tested without cloud creds.
  Shipping real adapter packages remains an option if a turnkey provider package is wanted later.)
- **Vision fit.** Portability (§2.7); neutral abstraction, provider adapters at the edge.
- **Docs.** `src/Benzene.Configuration.Core/CLAUDE.md`; cookbook `docs/cookbooks/secrets-configuration.md`.

### A.6 — Schema registry integration (`Benzene.SchemaRegistry.*`)

- **Requirement.** Manage/validate event payload schemas centrally (Confluent / Azure Schema
  Registry) for event-driven contracts.
- **Current state.** **Shipped** (`Benzene.SchemaRegistry.Core`, BCL-only, no new NuGet). Neutral
  `ISchemaRegistryClient` seam (register→id, get-by-id/latest, compatibility) with an
  `InMemorySchemaRegistryClient` reference impl + pluggable `ISchemaCompatibilityChecker`; the
  interop-critical `ConfluentWireFormat` codec (magic byte + big-endian schema-id framing);
  `SchemaRegistrySerializer` (an `IPayloadSerializer` decorator that frames any inner serializer's
  output using a startup-resolved id map — no per-message registry call); `ISchemaResolver` seam
  (Type→schema, keeps the package Avro-free) with a documented Avro adapter; and `SchemaRegistrar`
  (async startup register + `EnsureCompatibleAsync` evolution gate). 15 tests. Confluent/Azure
  registry clients are documented copy-paste adapters.
- **Original proposal.** Registry client integration for (de)serialization + schema evolution checks,
  complementing Avro and the A.2 contract gate. Benzene "lends itself to this" — uniform messages +
  existing serialization seam.
  (Delivered abstraction-first, same scope decision as A.5: the core + Confluent framing + in-memory
  registry ship BCL-only and fully tested; the vendor registry clients — `Confluent.SchemaRegistry`,
  `Azure.Data.SchemaRegistry` — are documented copy-paste adapters rather than SDK-dependency packages,
  since each is a new NuGet dep AGENTS.md gates and needs a live registry to integration-test.)
- **Vision fit.** Fits the serialization/contract story.
- **Docs.** `src/Benzene.SchemaRegistry.Core/CLAUDE.md`; cookbook `docs/cookbooks/schema-registry.md`.

---

## 4. Category B — Enable via existing seams + docs (thin or no new package)

### B.1 — Multi-tenancy (pattern, not machinery)

- **Requirement.** Tenant attribution + isolation for a multi-tenant B2B system.
- **Current state / seam.** The `PresetTopicHolder` pattern is exactly the mechanism: a **scoped
  `TenantHolder`** set by a **tenant-resolver middleware** (claim / header / subdomain), read by
  handlers and forwarded onto outbound `Clients`, `null`/guarded when absent — reusing per-message
  DI scope that already exists.
- **Decision.** Benzene does **not** need heavy isolation machinery. Ship a **cookbook** documenting
  the scoped-holder tenancy pattern; **optionally** a thin `Benzene.MultiTenancy` convenience that
  packages the holder + resolver strategies + a "tenant required" guard so teams don't rewrite it.
  Isolation of data/cache is achieved by the app using the tenant context (e.g. per-tenant cache
  key prefix, per-tenant connection string) — Benzene provides the context, not the storage policy.
- **Current state.** **Shipped as a cookbook** (`docs/cookbooks/multi-tenancy.md`). Documents the
  scoped `TenantHolder` (Context-purity seam, mirroring `PresetTopicHolder`/`AuthenticationHolder`), a
  strategy-driven `UseTenant` resolver middleware (auth claim / message header / HTTP subdomain), a
  `RequireTenant` guard that short-circuits with `BadRequest` via the result-setter idiom, and the
  app-side isolation uses (per-tenant cache prefix, connection string, data filter, outbound header
  propagation) plus the security guidance (prefer the tamper-proof claim; don't isolate on an
  unchecked client header; fail closed). The optional `Benzene.MultiTenancy` package was **not** built
  — the cookbook's closing "Do you need a package?" section explains why (nothing Benzene-specific
  remains once the holder + two middleware exist; isolation policy is per-app).
- **Vision fit.** Passes all five, precisely *because* it's the existing seam.

---

## 5. Category C — Out of scope for Benzene (user-space)

### C.1 — Unit-of-work / data access / transactions

Database access is not something Benzene does or has an opinion on. A per-message DB transaction,
repository/UoW, EF/Dapper conventions — all belong to the application inside the running process,
using whatever libraries it prefers. **Benzene stays out of the database.** (Note: this is why A.1
saga state and A.3 idempotency stores are *pluggable contracts*, not built-in persistence.)

### C.2 — Audit trail

An audit trail is domain-level (what counts as an auditable action, what the record means, retention
policy). Benzene shouldn't own a domain audit model. A team that wants one writes an audit middleware
using the principal/tenant context Benzene already exposes — the same way any other app-specific
cross-cutting concern is added. **Out of scope as a Benzene feature.**

---

## 6. Category D — Boundary case (decide before building)

### D.1 — Transactional outbox

The outbox's forward half (a relay reading pending events and publishing via `Benzene.Clients`) is
Benzene's outbound domain; its other half (writing the outbox row **inside the business DB
transaction**) is squarely the application's ORM/DB concern, which §5/C.1 says Benzene stays out of.
**Options:** (i) Benzene ships only a relay + a store *interface*, users implement the store against
their own transaction; (ii) defer entirely and let A.1 (sagas) cover multi-step consistency, which
in practice addresses much of what teams reach to an outbox for. **Recommend deferring** pending a
decision, and revisiting after A.1.

---

## 7. Category E — Open / undecided (parked, low priority)

- **Pagination** — a uniform `IPagedResult<T>` convention *could* help, but paging is partly
  domain. Undecided.
- **Feature flags** — a thin OpenFeature evaluation hook in the pipeline (tenant-aware once B.1
  lands). Small, optional; undecided.
- **Resilience depth** — extend `Benzene.Resilience` (retry-only) with circuit breaker / timeout /
  bulkhead / fallback. Framework-cross-cutting; reasonable later.
- **Delegated identity / token exchange** — outbound `Clients` propagating caller identity (OBO).
  Fits Clients; lower priority than the above.

## 9. Recommended sequence

1. **A.1 Sagas** — highest-value, production-proven, uniquely well-suited to Benzene's uniform
   message model; unlocks reliable multi-step distributed operations without orphaned records.
2. **A.3 Idempotency** + **A.2 Contract testing** — make the at-least-once async model and the
   service-to-service contracts trustworthy; A.2 is largely reuse of existing plumbing.
3. **A.4 Authorization depth** — clears the enterprise security-review bar.
4. **A.5 Secrets/config** and **A.6 Schema registry** as multi-cloud/event maturity needs dictate.
5. **B.1 Multi-tenancy** cookbook can land any time (cheap; documents an existing seam).

Everything in Category A is a cross-cutting concern or reliability primitive that fits Benzene's
model directly; Categories C and D keep Benzene out of the database and the domain.
