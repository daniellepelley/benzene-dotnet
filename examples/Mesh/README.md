# Benzene Service Mesh Example

Demonstrates Benzene's mesh end to end, both halves of it — merged into one page at
http://localhost:5300/mesh-ui:

- **The live Fleet plane** (the "Fleet" nav, plus the live sections on each service/topic page): the
  spec mesh (`docs/specification/mesh.md`) running for real. The services register their *derived*
  descriptors with a `Benzene.Mesh.Collector`, heartbeat every 10s, and trace every wire-envelope
  invocation; the checkout handler calls payments-api forwarding its mesh span, so the collector
  derives the `payments:get -> consumers: orders-api` edge and joins both services' events into one
  flow. Nothing on that plane is declared anywhere.
- **The artifact pipeline** (the default catalog view): three small demo services, a real Benzene app
  that aggregates their specs and health into a catalog, rendered by `/mesh-ui`. The live Fleet plane
  above enriches this catalog in place — the catalog is the spine, the observed data merges into it.

This is a demo with fake/canned data, meant for exploring the feature. For a config-driven version
you can run via Docker Compose against your own real services, see
[`deploy/Mesh/`](../../deploy/Mesh).

## What this shows

A single `./run.sh` drives the dashboard into **every state, badge, stat, and
per-check status at once** - no manual steps needed to see them:

- `orders-api` **healthy**, with three real health checks
  (`PostgresDatabase`, `RedisCache`, `SqsQueue`), each carrying a
  `Benzene.HealthChecks.Core.HealthCheckDependency` that renders as a
  dependency chip in the expanded detail view.
- `payments-api` **unhealthy AND contract-drift** - its `PaymentsGateway`
  check reports **failed** (gateway down) by default, a `FraudEngine` check
  reports a **warning** (degraded, amber badge), and a `PostgresDatabase`
  check reports **ok** - so the drill-down shows all three per-check statuses
  and their dependency chips side by side. `run.sh` also restarts it with a
  changed spec between two aggregation runs, so it earns a **drift** badge.
- `shipping-api` **unreachable** - deliberately never started, so it shows an
  `error` line instead of health-check detail.

`orders-api` also exposes a **consumer-side contract-drift check** against
payments-api at `GET /contracts` - a *separate* diagnostic surface from its
`/healthcheck`. `run.sh` curls it and you'll see the `payments-api` check report
`warning` with the drift verdict (the client was generated against
`payments-contract-v1`, payments-api now publishes `payments-contract-v2`).
This is deliberately **off** the `/healthcheck` (readiness) surface: a contract
check calls a downstream service, so wiring it into a liveness/readiness probe
would let a drifted or slow payments-api de-route or restart otherwise-healthy
orders-api pods (`UseContractsCheck` + `AddContractCheck`, see
[docs/kubernetes-health-checks.md](../../docs/kubernetes-health-checks.md) and
`work/client-health-checks-design.md`). Compare `GET /contracts` (has the
`payments-api` check) with `GET /healthcheck` (only the DB/cache/queue checks) -
that split is the whole point.

### Message versioning (payload upcasting + `/v{version}` routes + mesh compatibility)

`payments-api` demonstrates Benzene's [message versioning](../../docs/specification/versioning.md)
end to end, with a **single handler**:

- Its `payments:get` handler is written against the **V2** payload only (`[Message("payments:get", "2")]`,
  returning `V2.PaymentDto`, which added a `currency` field over V1). `AddHttpVersioning()` exposes it at
  three routes, and the payload caster bridges the versions from that one handler:
  - `GET /payments/{id}` → latest (V2, includes `"currency":"GBP"`)
  - `GET /v2/payments/{id}` → V2 (with currency)
  - `GET /v1/payments/{id}` → the V2 response **downcast to V1** (currency dropped) — same handler
- `orders-api` is still pinned to **v1**: it declares it produces `payments:get@1` (spec `events`), so the
  mesh sees a producer on v1 and a consumer on v2. The aggregator's **version compatibility** reconciliation
  (`topics.json` `versionCompatibility`) flags the skew, and the Mesh UI renders a **"Version compatibility"**
  panel on the `payments:get` topic page (produced `1`, consumed `2`, "produced, not consumed: 1"). The
  honest caveat the mesh states: an upcaster on the consumer — which the mesh can't see — bridges it, which
  is exactly what payments-api's V1→V2 caster does. Curl the three routes above to see one handler serve both
  wire versions, then open the topic page in the Mesh UI to see the skew surfaced.

Behind the dashboard:

- `Benzene.Mesh.Aggregator.MeshAggregator` polls each demo service's `/spec`
  and `/healthcheck` endpoints, hashes each spec to detect **contract drift**
  against the previous run, and publishes `manifest.json`/`services/*.json`
  to disk (`Benzene.Mesh.Aggregator.FileSystemMeshArtifactStore`).
- The aggregator is a **real, dogfooded Benzene app** - triggering a run is
  `POST /mesh/aggregate`, a `[Message("mesh:aggregate")]`/`[HttpEndpoint("POST",
  "/mesh/aggregate")]` handler like any other, not a bespoke CLI tool.
- `Benzene.Mesh.Ui.UseMeshUi()` serves the dashboard directly from the
  aggregator host - the "aggregator self-serves its own dashboard" case
  described in `Benzene.Mesh.Ui`'s own `CLAUDE.md`.
- `Benzene.Mesh.Tracing.Tempo.AddTempoTopology()` queries a **bundled fake
  Prometheus endpoint** (`/fake-prometheus/api/v1/query`, implemented in
  `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.Aggregator/FakePrometheus.cs`) instead of a real
  Tempo/Prometheus stack, publishing `topology.json` alongside
  `manifest.json`/`services/*.json`. This is deliberate: a real Tempo +
  Prometheus stack needs Docker and network egress this environment doesn't
  reliably have (see `work/service-mesh-roadmap-1.0.md`'s Phase 3 notes), and
  it keeps `./run.sh` fully self-contained - the same reason the rest of this
  example already fakes health/spec data deterministically rather than
  calling real external services. The Mesh UI renders `topology.json` as a
  sortable edge table (client, server, source, req/min, error rate,
  p50/p95/p99 latency) - see `Benzene.Mesh.Ui/CLAUDE.md`.

  `FakePrometheus.cs` returns canned data for three edges, each illustrating
  something different:

  | Edge | Req/min | Error rate | Latency (p50/p95/p99) | What it shows |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | orders-api → payments-api | 86.4 | 18% | 45/420/890ms | High traffic, elevated errors and latency - **echoes payments-api's `unhealthy` badge**, the same story confirmed two different ways (health check + observed traffic). |
  | orders-api → shipping-api | 24.1 | 0.4% | 12/35/58ms | Healthy-looking traffic to a service that's **unreachable right now** (shipping-api isn't started by default) - topology data is an independent signal from live health, not a replacement for it. |
  | payments-api → shipping-api | 6.2 | 0% (no failed sample at all) | 8/15/22ms | Low, clean traffic. The failed-request sample is omitted entirely rather than reported as `0` - real Prometheus never emits a `rate()` sample for a metric that's never incremented. |

See [`work/service-mesh-roadmap-1.0.md`](../../work/service-mesh-roadmap-1.0.md)
for the full design.

## Run it

```bash
cd examples/Mesh
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` starts `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.OrdersService` (port 5310),
`Benzene.Examples.Mesh.PaymentsService` (port 5311, **unhealthy by default**),
and `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.Aggregator` (port 5300) in the background, waits for
them to come up, then runs **two** aggregation passes to make contract drift
visible automatically (see below). It prints the URLs at the end.
`Benzene.Examples.Mesh.ShippingService` (port 5312) is **deliberately not
started** - see [Try it](#try-it).

- Mesh Explorer dashboard: http://localhost:5300/mesh-ui
- Raw manifest: http://localhost:5300/artifacts/manifest.json
- Raw topology: http://localhost:5300/artifacts/topology.json
- Orders spec: http://localhost:5310/spec?type=benzene
- Payments spec: http://localhost:5311/spec?type=benzene

Readiness polling targets `/spec?type=benzene` (which always returns 200), not
`/healthcheck` - payments-api is unhealthy by default and its `/healthcheck`
returns HTTP 503, which `curl -f` treats as a failure.

**How the two-run drift automation works:** `run.sh` aggregates once for a
baseline, then kills payments-api, waits for its port to stop responding,
restarts it with `DEMO_ADD_ENDPOINT=true` (which adds a `GET
/payments/{id}/refunds` operation to its spec), waits for it to come back, and
aggregates a second time. The spec's hash now differs from the baseline run's,
so `payments-api` earns a genuine - not simulated - drift badge on that second
pass. Drift always compares against the immediately preceding run.

Press Ctrl+C to stop everything `run.sh` started (including the restarted
payments-api process).

## Try it

Open the dashboard (http://localhost:5300/mesh-ui) after running `./run.sh`.
Out of the box you'll see `orders-api` healthy, `payments-api` unhealthy with a
drift badge, and `shipping-api` unreachable. Expand each card to see its
health-check detail. From there:

**See "unreachable" become "healthy"** - start the missing service, then
re-trigger a run:

```bash
dotnet run --project Benzene.Examples.Mesh.ShippingService --urls http://localhost:5312
curl -X POST http://localhost:5300/mesh/aggregate
```

Reload the dashboard (or click into the manifest URL again) to see
`shipping-api` flip to healthy, with `CarrierApi` and `SqsQueue` checks and
their `fedex-api`/`shipment-events` dependency chips.

**See "unhealthy" become "healthy"** - stop Payments (Ctrl+C in whichever
terminal it's running in, or kill its process), then restart it with
`DEMO_PAYMENTS_HEALTHY=true`:

```bash
DEMO_PAYMENTS_HEALTHY=true dotnet run --project Benzene.Examples.Mesh.PaymentsService --urls http://localhost:5311
curl -X POST http://localhost:5300/mesh/aggregate
```

`payments-api` now reports healthy - the `PaymentsGateway` check flips to ok,
the `FraudEngine` warning and `PostgresDatabase` ok checks stay as they were,
and the `stripe-gateway` dependency chip is visible in its expanded detail view
either way (see `PaymentsGatewayHealthCheck`).

**Re-run the drift demo by hand** - stop Payments and restart it *without*
`DEMO_ADD_ENDPOINT` and re-aggregate: the spec changes back, so drift reappears
for that one run, then clears again on the next unchanged run. Drift always
compares against the immediately preceding run, so re-aggregating without
restarting Payments (spec unchanged since the last run) clears the badge.

## What to look for

- `manifest.json`'s `services[].status` / `contractDrift` fields, and each
  `services/{name}.json`'s `health.healthChecks` map (with `dependencies`) -
  this is exactly what `Benzene.Mesh.Ui`'s `mesh-ui.html` fetches and renders,
  nothing hidden behind extra transformation.
- `topology.json`'s `edges[]` (client, server, source, requestsPerMinute,
  errorRate, p50/p95/p99LatencyMs) - published by `TempoTopologyMessageHandler`
  from the canned data in `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.Aggregator/FakePrometheus.cs`,
  rendered as the Mesh UI's sortable Topology table.
- `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.OrdersService/HealthChecks/OrdersHealthChecks.cs` for
  three healthy `IHealthCheck`s, each reporting a distinct dependency kind
  (`Database`/`Cache`/`Queue`).
- `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.PaymentsService/HealthChecks/PaymentsGatewayHealthCheck.cs`
  (failed by default, ok when `DEMO_PAYMENTS_HEALTHY=true`) and
  `.../HealthChecks/PaymentsHealthChecks.cs` (`PaymentsDatabaseHealthCheck` ok,
  `FraudEngineHealthCheck` a `CreateWarning` degraded check) - together they
  exercise all three per-check statuses in one service.
  `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.PaymentsService/Startup.cs` for the manual,
  env-var-gated `IHttpEndpointDefinition` registration (`DEMO_ADD_ENDPOINT`)
  that drives the contract-drift demo (mirrors how `SpecMessageHandler` itself
  is registered, since reflection-based handler discovery can't be toggled off
  at runtime).
- `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.ShippingService/HealthChecks/ShippingHealthChecks.cs`
  for the checks it would report if you started it manually.
- `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.Aggregator/Startup.cs` for the whole wiring: three
  lines (`AddMeshAggregator`, a static-file mount at `/artifacts`, and
  `UseMeshUi`) turn a plain ASP.NET Core app into a self-serving mesh
  dashboard.
- `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.OrdersService/Startup.cs` (and Payments/Shipping's,
  identically shaped) for the **Benzene Cloud Service** setup
  (`docs/specification/cloud-service-profile.md`): one
  `UseBenzeneCloudService("orders-api", cloud => ...)` call replaces the old
  hand-rolled `/benzene/invoke` branch + `StartAnnouncing()` pair
  (`MeshHost.cs`, now deleted - `Benzene.CloudService` generalizes what it
  used to do) with the wire-envelope endpoint, health checks, the derived
  spec, message handlers via the registry, and all four mesh service-side
  feeds, pre-wired in the right order and fully overridable.

## Notes

- Each demo service's `/spec` and `/healthcheck` are relocated from
  `UseBenzeneCloudService`'s `/benzene/spec`/`/benzene/health` defaults back
  to this demo's original `/spec`/`/healthcheck` paths (`WithSpecPath`/
  `WithHealthPath`), purely so the aggregator's hardcoded polling URLs above
  and `run.sh` keep working unchanged - a real deployment would just keep the
  defaults. The service's `CloudServiceProfileReport` (carried on its
  descriptor's `profile` field, visible via the live Fleet plane) honestly flags
  requirement R7 for that deliberate relocation.
- `SpecMessageHandler` and the health-check middleware don't carry
  `[HttpEndpoint]` attributes, so reflection-based discovery never picks them
  up on its own; `UseBenzeneCloudService` (like the old manual
  `IHttpEndpointDefinition` registration it replaces) wires them explicitly.
- `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.PaymentsService/Startup.cs` still registers
  `GetPaymentRefundsMessageHandler` manually, gated on `DEMO_ADD_ENDPOINT`
  (mirroring how `SpecMessageHandler` itself is registered) - reflection-based
  discovery can't be toggled off at runtime, and `UseBenzeneCloudService`'s
  handler registry picks up that DI registration the same way it picks up
  attribute-discovered handlers.
- `Benzene.Examples.Mesh.Shared/EnvelopeHost.cs`'s `EnvelopeHost` class is
  still used directly by the aggregator (as the collector's own envelope
  host) and its `EnvelopeClient` by `CheckoutOrderMessageHandler` for the
  orders→payments cross-service call; only each demo service's own
  now-superseded `MeshHost.cs` was removed.
- The aggregator's artifact directory (`mesh-artifacts/`, next to its build
  output) is created on first run and persists between runs, which is what
  makes contract-drift detection meaningful - it's always comparing against
  the previous run's actual output, not a clean slate.
