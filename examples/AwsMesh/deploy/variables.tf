Lower it (e.g. rate(1 minute), matching the AzureFunctionsMesh timer) when you want near-live catalog freshness.

    ARN of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) collector Lambda layer. When set, it is attached to
    every function and Benzene's OTLP exporter is pointed at the layer's in-process collector
    (http://localhost:4317) automatically — the collector's default config forwards OTLP traces to X-Ray
    (awsxray), so the per-middleware spans land as subsegments in the same X-Ray trace as the AWS-level
    segments. No AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER is set — these are custom-runtime functions that already emit
    their own spans, so only the collector half of the layer is used. Set empty ("") to not attach it.

    The default is the amd64 collector layer in eu-west-1, matching this config's default region + x86_64
    architecture. A Lambda layer is regional and arch-specific, so if you change var.region or
    var.lambda_architecture you MUST change this ARN to match (swap the region substring, and
    amd64<->arm64). Bump the ver-X-Y-Z from https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-lambda/releases.
