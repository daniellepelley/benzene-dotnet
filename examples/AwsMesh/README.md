# AWS Mesh Self-Discovery — end-to-end example

A deployable AWS example that proves the Benzene mesh **self-discovery** story end to end: **six**
Benzene Cloud Services running as Lambdas that call each other over **SQS, SNS and EventBridge**, plus
a **mesh service** (a seventh Lambda) that discovers them by tag, interrogates each, and serves the
Mesh UI — all fronted by API Gateway so you can open the UIs in a browser.

The six services dogfood Benzene's transports by using **each one for what it's actually good at**
(commands vs fan-out events vs routed integration events), so the Mesh UI's topology renders a real,
non-trivial graph. See `work/aws-mesh-multi-transport-plan.md` for the plan and
`work/mesh-self-discovery-design.md` for the discovery design this example exercises.

```

- The six **service Lambdas** are full Cloud Service Profile (R1–R8) services: `/benzene/invoke`,
  `/benzene/spec`, `/benzene/health`, `/benzene/spec-ui`, plus any domain routes — and they answer
  the mesh's **direct Lambda-Invoke** interrogation (`spec`/`healthcheck` topics) with no HTTP surface
  required. They carry a `benzene` resource tag so discovery finds them.
- The **mesh Lambda** runs, on an EventBridge schedule: discovery (`AwsLambdaDiscoveryProvider` →
  `ListFunctions`+`ListTags`, filtered by the `benzene` tag) → writes `registry.json` to S3 → the
  aggregator interrogates each discovered Lambda by Invoke → writes the catalog artifacts to S3. Its
  HTTP surface serves the **Mesh UI** (reading those artifacts).

| `.github/workflows/deploy-aws-mesh-example.yml` | GitHub Actions: build all 7 Lambdas + `terraform apply` | | |

Each service Lambda is a **self-contained executable** hosting the Benzene pipeline via an
`Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport` bootstrap — because .NET 10 has no managed Lambda runtime, they deploy
on the **`provided.al2023`** custom runtime (self-contained publish).

## OpenTelemetry (traces + metrics)

Every Lambda (the six services and the mesh) wires **full OpenTelemetry**: Benzene's instrumentation
(`AddBenzeneInstrumentation`) for traces and metrics, exported over **OTLP**, plus the pipeline
middleware `UseW3CTraceContext` → `UseBenzeneEnrichment` → `UseBenzeneMetrics` on every transport. The
W3C trace-context propagation is what stitches the **order → payment → shipment** spans (across the SQS
hops) into a single distributed trace — feed it to Grafana Tempo and the mesh's Topology can show
*observed* edges on top of the structural ones.

Two things are different from a typical Generic-Host app, because a bare AWS Lambda host has no `IHost`
(see `Shared/LambdaTelemetry.cs`):

- **The providers are built eagerly.** `services.AddOpenTelemetry()` only *constructs* the
  `TracerProvider`/`MeterProvider` from a hosted service that never runs under a Lambda host — so the
  `"Benzene"` `ActivitySource` would get no listener and **no middleware spans would ever be recorded**.
  `LambdaTelemetry.Configure` builds them with `Sdk.Create*ProviderBuilder().Build()` at startup instead,
  which attaches the listener immediately.
- **Spans are force-flushed per invocation.** `TracingLambdaHost` (the `AwsLambdaHost` subclass every
  `Function` uses) overrides `OnInvocationCompleteAsync` to `ForceFlush` the batched exporters before the
  execution environment freezes, so the current invocation's spans aren't delayed to the next invocation
  or dropped on scale-in.

**X-Ray active tracing** (`tracing_config { mode = "Active" }`) is turned on for every function
automatically — but note it only captures the **AWS-level** segments (the `AWS::Lambda::Function`
segments and their `Overhead` subsegments). Benzene's **per-middleware** spans are OpenTelemetry spans
that leave the process over **OTLP**, a separate pipe that needs a collector to reach X-Ray.

To bridge them, **`var.adot_collector_layer_arn`** (defaulted to the eu-west-1 amd64 ADOT collector
layer) attaches the collector to every function and points `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at its
in-process receiver (`http://localhost:4317`). The layer's *default* config is **metrics-only** (it
drops traces), so the Terraform also sets `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_URI=/var/task/collector.yaml`
to select the [`collector.yaml`](collector.yaml) shipped in each Lambda zip, which adds the
`traces → awsxray` pipeline. (No `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` is set: these custom-runtime functions
already emit their own spans, so only the collector half of the layer is used.) `var.otlp_endpoint` is
an escape hatch for pointing at an out-of-process collector instead. With neither set, spans are
recorded but exported nowhere.

### End-to-end cross-service traces (one X-Ray trace per transaction)
The point of the OTel path here is that **a whole transaction — `order:create` → (EventBridge/SNS/SQS) →
the next service's topic → …  — shows up as ONE trace** you can read end to end, in X-Ray and in the Mesh
UI's flow waterfall. Two things make that work, and both are wired in this example:

1. **The trace context is propagated on every outbound send.** `MeshServiceWiring`'s outbound routes run
   `.UseW3CTraceContext().UseCorrelationId()` before the transport, so the current activity's `traceparent`
   (and `x-correlation-id`) ride the message — as an SQS/SNS message attribute, or embedded in the
   EventBridge `Detail`. The receiving service's inbound `UseW3CTraceContext()` (in `Observe()`) then
   **continues the same trace** instead of starting a fresh one. Without the *outbound* half, each service
   began its own trace and you saw disconnected single-service flows.
2. **The root trace id is X-Ray-compatible.** `LambdaTelemetry` adds OpenTelemetry's `AddXRayTraceId()`
   (the `OpenTelemetry.Extensions.AWS` id generator), so the first service mints an X-Ray-format
   (epoch-prefixed) id; downstream services inherit it via the propagated `traceparent`. Every hop then
   lands under **one** X-Ray trace id, which the ADOT collector's `traces → awsxray` pipeline exports as a
   single X-Ray trace. (The default random OTel id maps to an out-of-range X-Ray timestamp, which X-Ray
   drops — which is why cross-service traces didn't line up before.)

**One tracing path on purpose (OTel, not the X-Ray SDK).** This example runs the OTel path *alone*
(`AddDiagnostics` → OTLP → the ADOT collector → X-Ray) and does **not** also wire
`Benzene.Aws.Lambda.XRay`'s `AddXRayTracing()`. That X-Ray-SDK path nests middleware subsegments under the
Lambda's own segment via `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID`, which only propagates through AWS's `AWSTraceHeader` — and
Benzene doesn't inject that on an outbound send, so it can **only** stitch within a single Lambda
invocation. Running it alongside OTel would add a second, per-hop-rooted representation that muddies the
cross-service view, so we pick the one path that stitches end to end. (`AddXRayTracing()` remains a valid
library option when you want the classic in-segment X-Ray breakdown for a *single* Lambda with no
collector — it's just not what an end-to-end mesh wants.)

### Topic usage → the Mesh UI (metrics, not just traces)
The same `UseBenzeneMetrics()` on every pipeline emits the `benzene.messages.processed` counter tagged
`topic`/`transport`/`result`. The collector's `metrics` pipeline exports it to **CloudWatch** via the
`awsemf` (Embedded Metric Format) exporter (`collector.yaml`) into the `Benzene/Mesh` namespace, dimensions
`[topic, transport, result]`, in the `/benzene/mesh/usage` log group. The counter is exported with **delta**
temporality (`LambdaTelemetry`) so a CloudWatch `Sum` over a window equals the request count.

The mesh Lambda then reads it back: `AddCloudWatchUsage(...)` registers
`Benzene.Mesh.Usage.CloudWatch`'s `IMeshUsageSource`, which the aggregator pulls each run to write
`usage.json` — per-topic request counts over `var.usage_window_hours` (default 24h). The **Mesh UI** renders
those as a Usage column on the estate topic table plus per-topic by-transport / by-status breakdowns and the
window. IAM: the service role gains CloudWatch Logs perms on the usage group (`service_emf`), and the mesh
role gains `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`/`ListMetrics` (in its policy). This is deliberately coarse — request
counts over a window; fine-grained analysis stays in CloudWatch/Grafana. (Per-service attribution and
duration are documented follow-ups — the counter isn't tagged by service, so `usage.json` reports that
dimension as absent, which the UI surfaces honestly rather than guessing.)

#### Generate traffic with the Lambda test tool
There's nothing to show until services actually handle messages. The quickest way to create some is the
**Test** tab on a service Lambda in the console (or `aws lambda invoke`). On a direct invoke the services
accept the **Benzene message envelope** `{ "topic", "headers", "body" }` — note `body` is a *string* holding
the message JSON (escaped quotes), and it flows through the same metered pipeline. Which Lambda handles
which topic: `orders:*` → orders, `payments:*` → payments, `shipping:*` → shipping; the events `order:placed`
→ inventory/notifications, `payment:captured` → notifications/analytics, `shipping:dispatched` →
inventory/notifications/analytics.

**Best starting point — `orders:create` on the `orders` Lambda.** Because the queues/topics/bus are wired,
the handler's downstream sends fire for real, so one invoke fans out `payments:capture` (SQS) →
`shipping:book` (SQS) → `shipping:dispatched` (EventBridge) → the consumers — giving traffic across many
topics and the **sqs/sns/eventbridge** transports, not just the invoke path. Fire it a dozen times:

```json
{ "topic": "orders:create", "headers": {}, "body": "{\"item\":\"Espresso Machine\",\"quantity\":2}" }
```

Per-topic payloads to hit any service directly (these count under the *invoke* transport):

```json
{ "topic": "payments:capture",    "headers": {}, "body": "{\"orderId\":\"ord-1\",\"amount\":20,\"currency\":\"GBP\"}" }
{ "topic": "shipping:book",       "headers": {}, "body": "{\"orderId\":\"ord-1\",\"carrier\":\"DPD\"}" }
{ "topic": "order:placed",        "headers": {}, "body": "{\"orderId\":\"ord-1\",\"item\":\"Espresso Machine\",\"quantity\":2,\"amount\":20,\"currency\":\"GBP\"}" }
{ "topic": "payment:captured",    "headers": {}, "body": "{\"orderId\":\"ord-1\",\"amount\":20,\"currency\":\"GBP\"}" }
{ "topic": "shipping:dispatched", "headers": {}, "body": "{\"orderId\":\"ord-1\",\"shipmentId\":\"shp-1\",\"carrier\":\"DPD\",\"trackingNumber\":\"DPD-123\"}" }
{ "topic": "orders:get-all",      "headers": {}, "body": "" }
```

Or from the CLI (`--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out` lets AWS CLI v2 take a raw JSON payload):

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name <orders-fn-name> --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
  --payload '{"topic":"orders:create","headers":{},"body":"{\"item\":\"Espresso Machine\",\"quantity\":2}"}' /dev/stdout
```

Notes: the counter is recorded around the whole pipeline, so **every** invoke produces a datapoint — a
payload that fails validation just lands as `result=failure`. Validation to respect: `orders:create` needs a
non-empty item and quantity 1–1000; `payments:capture` a 3-char currency and amount > 0; `shipping:book` a
carrier in {DPD, RoyalMail, UPS, FedEx}. After firing a batch, give the metric ~1–2 min to reach CloudWatch,
`POST /mesh/refresh` to aggregate now (instead of waiting for the schedule), then check `usage.json` / the
Mesh UI Usage column.

## What each service shows off

Every service is wired through the shared `Shared/MeshServiceWiring` helper, which "goes to town" on
Benzene's features so the example dogfoods them on a real deploy:

- **One set of handlers, five transports.** Each domain handler is reachable over **API Gateway**
  (HTTP), **direct Lambda invoke** (BenzeneMessage), **SQS**, **SNS**, and **EventBridge** — the same
  handler, no per-transport code. Fire any of them from the **Lambda test tool**: each service ships
  saved requests under `.lambda-test-tool/SavedRequests/` (e.g. `orders-create-sqs.json`,
  `orders-create-eventbridge.json`, `orders-create-direct.json`, `orders-create-apigateway.json`).
- **Tracing/logging across every pipeline.** Every transport pipeline is wrapped with
  `UseLogResult` + a **correlation id**, emitting a structured JSON log line per invocation (request,
  response, `processTime`) to stdout → **CloudWatch**.
- **Validation everywhere.** Each domain request has a **FluentValidation** validator applied via
  `router.UseFluentValidation()`, so an invalid payload is rejected identically no matter which
  transport it arrived on.

## Interconnectivity → topology — one transport per job

The six services form a live fulfilment flow, and **each transport is used for what it's good at** —
that's the whole point of the dogfood, and what makes the Mesh UI topology worth looking at:

| Transport | Idiomatic for | In this example |
|---|---|---|
| **SQS** | a point-to-point **command** — one consumer, must arrive, retry/DLQ | `orders → payments` (`payments:capture`), `payments → shipping` (`shipping:book`) |
| **SNS** | a **fan-out event** — one publisher, many subscribers | `orders` publishes `order:placed` → **inventory _and_ notifications** |
| **EventBridge** | **routed integration events** — content rules, one event → many targets | `payments` publishes `payment:captured`, `shipping` publishes `shipping:dispatched` → routed to **notifications / inventory / analytics** |

The flow:

- `orders-api`, on `orders:create`: **sends** `payments:capture` (SQS command) **and** publishes
  `order:placed` (SNS event).
- `payments-api`, on `payments:capture`: **sends** `shipping:book` (SQS command) **and** publishes
  `payment:captured` (EventBridge event).
- `shipping-api`, on `shipping:book`: books the shipment and publishes `shipping:dispatched`
  (EventBridge event).
- `inventory-api` reserves stock on `order:placed` (SNS) and decrements it on `shipping:dispatched`
  (EventBridge) — one service consuming from **two** event transports.
- `notifications-api` notifies the customer on `order:placed` (SNS) + `payment:captured` +
  `shipping:dispatched` (EventBridge).
- `analytics-api` records metrics on `payment:captured` + `shipping:dispatched` (EventBridge).

Every hop goes through the same Benzene `IBenzeneMessageSender` (`AddOutboundRouting` → `UseSqs` /
`UseSns` / `UseEventBridge`), and the receiving side is just the matching Benzene ingress the shared
wiring already registers (`aws.UseSqs` / `aws.UseSns` / `aws.UseEventBridge`) — the **same handler**, no
per-transport code. The choice of transport per send lives entirely in each service's `Startup`
(`OutboundSend.Sqs/Sns/EventBridge(...)`). Terraform provisions the two SQS queues + event-source
mappings, the SNS topic + Lambda subscriptions, and a **custom EventBridge bus** + rules + targets, plus
the send/publish IAM. Sends are best-effort, so a downstream hiccup never fails the upstream call (and
locally, with no target wired, they just log).

Because each service also **declares** what it sends (in its spec's `events`), the mesh aggregator
derives a **structural topology** — an edge from each sender to each consuming handler — and publishes
`topology.json`, **transport-agnostically** (an SQS command, an SNS event and an EventBridge event all
surface as edges the same way). After a refresh the Mesh UI's **Topology** table shows the whole graph
(`orders → payments`, `orders → inventory`, `orders → notifications`, `payments → shipping`, `payments →
notifications`, `payments → analytics`, `shipping → inventory/notifications/analytics`), source
`structural`, no tracing backend required. Layer on `Benzene.Mesh.Tracing.Tempo` to add *observed* edges
(real req-rate / error / latency) on top.

**See the flow fire:** invoke `orders-api` (any transport — `orders-create-sqs.json`, the API, …), then
watch CloudWatch: `orders` logs "sent payments:capture" + "published order:placed"; `inventory` and
`notifications` log the `order:placed` fan-out; `payments` logs "sent shipping:book" + "published
payment:captured"; `shipping` logs the booking + "published shipping:dispatched"; `analytics` logs its
metrics — all tied together by the propagated correlation id.

## Deploy it (via GitHub Actions — no local tooling)

Tooling: **Terraform, run by GitHub Actions**, fronted by **API Gateway HTTP APIs** (one per Lambda,
so each service's Spec UI and the Mesh UI serve their relative assets from their own API root).

1. **Add two repo secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — an IAM principal allowed to manage Lambda, IAM,
     S3, API Gateway, and EventBridge.
2. **Run the workflow**: Actions → **Deploy AWS Mesh Example** → *Run workflow* (pick a region).
   It builds all seven Lambdas (self-contained `provided.al2023`), then `terraform apply`s the stack.
3. **Grab the URLs** from the workflow's final `terraform output` step:
   - `mesh_ui_url` — the Mesh UI.
   - `service_spec_ui_urls` — each service's Spec UI.
   - `mesh_refresh_url` — POST to force a discovery+aggregation pass now.

### Deploy locally instead (if you do have Terraform)

State is kept in a per-account S3 bucket (`benzene-mesh-tfstate-<account-id>`) so repeated runs are
incremental rather than colliding — configured at `init` time, so nothing account-specific is
committed. Create the bucket once, then `init` against it:

```bash
# Build + zip each Lambda (self-contained, provided.al2023) into examples/AwsMesh/artifacts/, then:
cd examples/AwsMesh/deploy
ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket "benzene-mesh-tfstate-$ACCOUNT" --region eu-west-1 \
  --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1   # omit --create-bucket-configuration in us-east-1
terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=benzene-mesh-tfstate-$ACCOUNT" \
  -backend-config="key=aws-mesh/terraform.tfstate" \
  -backend-config="region=eu-west-1"
# If resources already exist from an earlier run without persisted state, adopt them first:
REGION=eu-west-1 PROJECT=benzene-mesh ./adopt-existing.sh
terraform apply -var region=eu-west-1
```

If an earlier run failed *midway*, the account can end up with duplicate/partial resources (API
Gateway allows duplicate names), which makes adoption ambiguous. Recover with a one-time clean slate —
delete every app resource (never the state bucket), then recreate:

```bash
REGION=eu-west-1 PROJECT=benzene-mesh ./cleanup-all.sh
terraform apply -var region=eu-west-1
```

In the GitHub Actions workflow this is the **`recreate`** checkbox on *Run workflow* — tick it once to
recover, then leave it off for normal incremental deploys.

## See it working (both ends)

1. **Open a service Spec UI** (`service_spec_ui_urls.orders`, etc.) — proof the services are up
   and Cloud Service Profile-conformant, each with its own domain contract and health.
2. **Trigger a mesh pass**: `curl -XPOST "$mesh_refresh_url"` (or wait for the schedule — every minute
   by default, `var.aggregate_schedule`). It returns `{ "discovered": 6 }` once it has found the six
   `benzene`-tagged Lambdas. The schedule keeps the catalog + usage feed fresh on its own; the Mesh UI
   explorer loads artifacts once per page load, so reload the page to pick up a newer pass.
3. **Open the Mesh UI** (`mesh_ui_url`) — the catalog of the six services the mesh **discovered by
   itself** (no `mesh.json`), each interrogated by direct Lambda-Invoke, with health and dependencies.
   Below the service list, the **Topics** table is the cross-service catalog (every topic across the
   platform → which service owns it, its HTTP mapping, domain vs utility), with a **show utilities**
   toggle that hides the reserved Benzene endpoints by default.
4. **Open a service's Spec UI** and note the **Benzene utilities** panel — the reserved
   `spec`/`health`/`mesh` endpoints are collapsed out of the service's domain topics.

That's the end-to-end test: services on one end, the self-discovering mesh on the other.

The `POST $mesh_refresh_url` endpoint returns **201 Created** (a pass creates/refreshes the catalog
artifacts) with `{ "discovered": N }`.

## How discovery is scoped

- The six **service** Lambdas carry a `benzene` **resource tag**; the **mesh** Lambda does not — so
  the mesh discovers the services but never itself. Change the tag key via the `discovery_tag_key`
  Terraform variable (and the mesh's filter) to match your own tagging.
- The mesh's IAM role gets exactly `lambda:ListFunctions` + `lambda:ListTags` (discover),
  `lambda:InvokeFunction` scoped to the six services (interrogate), and `s3:*Object`/`ListBucket`
  on the artifact bucket. Read + describe-invoke only.

## Cost: this demo is not free while it merely exists

A standing deploy costs money without anyone using it. The scheduled aggregation invokes the mesh
Lambda, which fans spec + healthcheck calls out to all six services, and **every one of those is
X-Ray-traced and CloudWatch-metered**. The X-Ray free tier has two separate dimensions and the demo
can exhaust either:

| Free-tier dimension | Limit / month | What consumes it here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traces **recorded** | 100,000 | Every sampled span the services + mesh emit |
| Traces **retrieved or scanned** (`Global-XRay-TracesAccessed`) | 1,000,000 | The Mesh UI's live queries — `GetTraceSummaries` **scans every trace in the picked window on each poll** |

The second one is the surprising one: the bill grows with *how much you look*, not just how much
traffic there is. Three knobs, all defaulted for a cheap standing demo:

- **`trace_sample_rate`** (default `0.2`) — a parent-based ratio sampler, so a transaction is sampled
  or dropped as a whole and the mesh never shows half a flow. Cuts **both** dimensions at once: fewer
  traces recorded also means fewer traces for every query to scan. Set to `1` to record everything.
- **`aggregate_schedule`** (default `rate(15 minutes)`) — the standing traffic floor. At
  `rate(1 minute)` the idle demo alone produces roughly 20k Lambda invocations and 35k traces a day.
- **The Mesh UI's own polling** — 15s for the live plane, 5 min for the 24h issue inbox, **paused
  entirely while the browser tab is hidden**, and the inbox asks for counts only (`includeFlows:
  false`) so it never triggers a day-wide trace scan. No configuration needed; just be aware that a
  dashboard left open on-screen is the single biggest consumer of the *retrieved* dimension.

If you only need the demo occasionally, **tear it down between sessions** (below) — that takes the
cost to zero, and a redeploy is one workflow run.

## Teardown

**Via GitHub Actions (recommended):** run the **Destroy AWS Mesh Example** workflow
(`.github/workflows/destroy-aws-mesh-example.yml`) — the counterpart of the deploy workflow. It uses
the same remote S3 state, so it destroys exactly what the deploy created. Type `DESTROY` to confirm,
pick the region you deployed to, and optionally tick **Also delete the Terraform state bucket** for a
full cleanup. Beyond `terraform destroy` it also empties the artifacts bucket first (S3 refuses to
delete a non-empty bucket) and deletes the `/aws/lambda/benzene-mesh-*` log groups Lambda creates
implicitly — neither is a Terraform resource, and both would otherwise linger and keep billing.

**Locally:**

```bash
# Terraform evaluates the whole config to plan a destroy, and the S3 code objects call filemd5() on
# the Lambda zips — so the artifacts have to exist even though a destroy uploads nothing. If you no
# longer have them (a fresh clone, or you cleaned the build), stand in empty placeholders first:
mkdir -p examples/AwsMesh/artifacts
for n in orders payments shipping inventory notifications analytics mesh; do
  : > "examples/AwsMesh/artifacts/$n.zip"
done

cd examples/AwsMesh/deploy && terraform destroy
```

Note the local path leaves the implicit CloudWatch log groups behind; delete them with
`aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name /aws/lambda/benzene-mesh-<service>` if you want a clean
account.

## Cold-start tuning

.NET on Lambda has a real cold-start cost, and it is **mostly not Benzene** — it's JIT compilation
and reflection-driven code generation (System.Text.Json metadata, DI graph build, handler/validator
reflection) that only runs once per fresh execution environment. Optimising it well is what lets an
X-Ray trace isolate Benzene's own overhead from the .NET/AWS floor. What this example already does,
and the levers beyond it, in rough order of value-for-effort:

**Already applied here:**
- **ReadyToRun** — the publish step (`.github/workflows/deploy-aws-mesh-example.yml`) uses
  `-p:PublishReadyToRun=true`, precompiling IL to native so most framework/app code doesn't JIT at
  startup. This is the standard first move and it's on.
- **`InvariantGlobalization=true`** — every service `.csproj` sets it (also required because
  `provided.al2023` ships no libicu). Skips ICU load at init.
- **Shared static Lambda event serializer** — `AwsLambdaMiddlewareRouter` caches the
  `DefaultLambdaJsonSerializer` statically so the (large) AWS event type's STJ metadata is built once
  per process, not per invocation (see `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Core`).
- **Framework warm-up (opt-in)** — `AddBenzeneWarmUp()` pre-builds each handler's request **and
  response** STJ metadata and each FluentValidation rule set during Lambda INIT, invisibly (no
  synthetic message, no logs/metrics/traces). Enable it in the service startup to move those
  first-message JIT gaps into INIT. See `Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers` → *Cold-start warm-up*.
- **Memory = 1024 MB** (services; the mesh was already 1024). Lambda scales vCPU with memory and
  cold start is CPU-bound, so this roughly halves init/JIT wall time vs 512 MB. Dial to ~1769 MB for
  a full vCPU (shortest cold start) or back to 512 to minimise cost — one line in `deploy/main.tf`.

**Remaining levers (not applied — each has a real trade-off):**
- **Source-generated JSON** *(event types done)* — the largest unwarmed cost was STJ's reflection-based
  metadata build for the AWS event types. **Every event-source adapter now uses a source-generated
  context** (API Gateway v1/v2 + custom authorizer, SQS, SNS, S3, EventBridge, DynamoDB, Kinesis, Kafka,
  and the BenzeneMessage direct-invoke path), so the cold event→Benzene conversion no longer pays the
  event-type metadata build. Still a follow-up: the same treatment for the message **payload** types
  (app-authored or Benzene-generated context wired into the media format).
- **arm64 (Graviton)** — usually better price/performance and competitive cold start. Requires
  flipping `lambda_architecture` to `arm64`, the CI `RID` to `linux-arm64`, **and** the ADOT collector
  layer ARN (see `variables.tf`) to the matching arm64 build — a coordinated change, so it's opt-in.
- **ADOT collector overhead** — the trace's ~26 ms `extensionOverhead` (and some INIT weight) is the
  telemetry extension, not Benzene. If cold latency matters more than full-fidelity tracing, sample
  traces or drop the collector layer.
- **Provisioned concurrency** — the guaranteed-warm escape hatch: pre-initialised environments, no
  cold start on the covered concurrency, at standing cost. The blunt-instrument option when a specific
  path must never pay init.

**Deliberately *not* done — these would break this app:**
- **Trimming (`PublishTrimmed`)** — Benzene discovers handlers, resolves DI, and builds
  FluentValidation rules by reflection, and the default serializer is reflection-based STJ. Trimming
  strips types those paths need at runtime → failures that don't show at build time. Don't enable it
  without full trim annotations and source-gen serialization first.
- **Native AOT** — the biggest cold-start win in principle, but incompatible as-is for the same
  reflection/DI/reflection-STJ reasons; it would require source-generating serialization and reworking
  reflection-based discovery. A project, not a setting.
- **SnapStart** — not available on the `provided.al2023` **custom** runtime (SnapStart covers managed
  runtimes only), and .NET 10 has no managed Lambda runtime — so it's off the table for this deployment.

## Known first-deploy iteration points

I can build and compile all of this, but the live AWS behaviour is only verifiable on a real deploy.
The most likely things to tweak on the first run (all localized):
- **Custom-runtime packaging** — the `bootstrap` wrapper + self-contained publish RID/arch
  (`lambda_architecture` must match the CI `RID`). Note the `provided.al2023` runtime ships **no
  libicu**, so all seven Lambda projects publish with `<InvariantGlobalization>true</InvariantGlobalization>`
  — without it the apphost aborts at init with "Couldn't find a valid ICU package installed".
- **API Gateway payload format** — pinned to `1.0` to match `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway`; if a UI
  route 500s, this is the first thing to check.
- **EventBridge → topic routing** — both the `mesh:aggregate` schedule and the inter-service
  integration events (`payment:captured`, `shipping:dispatched`) rely on the Benzene EventBridge adapter
  reading `detail-type` as the topic. The custom-bus rules match on that same `detail-type`; if a
  consumer never fires, confirm the publisher's `DetailType` and the rule's `event_pattern` agree (POST
  `mesh_refresh_url` triggers a pass independently of any of this).
- **SNS fan-out routing** — `order:placed` carries the Benzene topic in the `topic` **message
  attribute**; the SNS→Lambda subscription delivers it to inventory-api and notifications-api, whose
  `aws.UseSns` ingress routes on that attribute. If a subscriber doesn't route, check the attribute is
  present on the published message.
