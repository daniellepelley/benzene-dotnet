# Benzene Examples — Guide for Claude Code

## What this is
Runnable sample applications that demonstrate Benzene across every host and transport it supports.
Their main job is to show the framework's central promise in practice: **write your message handlers
once, host them anywhere.** The same handlers run behind ASP.NET, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, gRPC,
Kafka, and Google Cloud by swapping only the host wiring.

These are documentation-by-example and manual/deploy test beds — not the library itself (that's
`src/`) and not the unit tests (that's `test/`).

## The shared domain: `App/Benzene.Examples.App`
The most important project here. It holds the transport-agnostic business logic — `Handlers/`,
`Validators/`, `Services/`, `Model/Messages/`, `Data/`, `Results/` — and is referenced by almost every
host example (Asp, Aws, Azure, Google, Grpc, Kafka). A host example is then mostly just a `StartUp`
that wires this shared domain onto one transport. When adding a demo capability, prefer putting the
handler/logic in `Benzene.Examples.App` and wiring it from the hosts, rather than duplicating it.

`App/Benzene.Examples.App.Data` is a small companion data project.

## Layout (one folder per host/transport)
- **`App/`** — shared handlers/validators/services (above); the reused core.
- **`Asp/`** — ASP.NET Core host. Two projects:
  - `Benzene.Example.Asp.Minimal` — the smallest thing that works: the runnable version of
    [docs/getting-started.md](../docs/getting-started.md) (`GET /hello/{name}` only), using the
    documented `BenzeneStartUp` + `WebApplicationBuilder.UseBenzene<StartUp>()` model. Start newcomers here.
  - `Benzene.Example.Asp` — the fuller host: Spec UI (`/spec-ui`) + `spec` endpoint, FluentValidation,
    Serilog, controllers, and an OAuth2-protected `/protected/ping` route. It wires Benzene by hand via
    `IApplicationBuilder.UseBenzene(builder => builder.UseHttp(...))` (the other documented ASP.NET path,
    see [docs/hosting.md](../docs/hosting.md)) because it needs native ASP.NET plumbing —
    `UseRouting`/`UseAuthorization`/`MapControllers` and an `app.Map("/protected", ...)` branch — that a
    single `BenzeneStartUp.Configure(IBenzeneApplicationBuilder, …)` can't reach.
- **`Aws/`** — AWS Lambda host demonstrating multiple event sources (API Gateway + custom authorizer,
  SNS, SQS, Kafka, EventBridge) in one function. Also demonstrates **egress** alongside ingress:
  `PublishOrderCreatedMessageHandler` + `DependenciesBuilder`'s `AddOutboundRouting(...)` wiring —
  see [docs/clients.md](../docs/clients.md#runnable-example-the-ingressegress-symmetry).
- **`Azure/`** — Azure Functions host. Same egress demonstration as `Aws/` above, via Service Bus.
- **`Grpc/`** — gRPC host (+ a client project).
- **`Kafka/`** — Kafka consumer and producer.
- **`Google/`** — Google Cloud host (built on `Benzene.AspNet.Core` + `Benzene.Http`).
- **`Cloudflare/`** — ASP.NET Core host deployed via Cloudflare Containers (a Worker proxies HTTP
  into a Docker container running this project); has its own `README.md`, `Dockerfile`, and
  `worker/` (wrangler.toml + TypeScript Worker). Built on `Benzene.AspNet.Core` +
  `Benzene.HealthChecks`, same as `Asp/`/`Google/` — no Cloudflare-specific Benzene package.
- **`CodeGen/`** — client code generation from a spec (`Benzene.CodeGen.Client`, `Benzene.Schema.OpenApi`);
  does **not** use the shared `App` domain.
- **`OpenTelemetry/`** — observability demo (`Benzene.OpenTelemetry`, traces/metrics); has its own
  `README.md` and a `wwwroot/` message-sender page. Does **not** use the shared `App` domain.
- **`Mesh/`** — service-mesh visibility demo: three tiny demo services plus an aggregator app that
  dogfoods `Benzene.Mesh.Aggregator`/`Benzene.Mesh.Tracing.Tempo`/`Benzene.Mesh.Ui` (self-serves the
  dashboard via `UseMeshUi`; Tempo integration is demonstrated against a bundled fake Prometheus
  endpoint, not a real Tempo stack — see `FakePrometheus.cs`); has its own `README.md` and `run.sh`.
  Does **not** use the shared `App` domain.
- **`K8sMesh/`** — the Kubernetes counterpart of `AwsMesh`: three Cloud Service pods (one image,
  `MESH_SERVICE` selects the domain) discovered by label via `Benzene.Mesh.Discovery.Kubernetes`,
  plus a mesh pod serving the Mesh UI. The same `k8s/` manifests (a kustomize base) deploy two ways:
  credential-free on kind (`deploy-k8s-mesh-example.yml`) and on real AWS EKS via `deploy/`
  (Terraform: EKS + ECR) + the `deploy/eks` overlay (`deploy-eks-mesh-example.yml`, which ends with
  the Mesh UI on a public ELB URL). Has its own `README.md`. Does **not** use the shared `App` domain.
- **`AzureMesh/`** — the Azure counterpart: three Cloud Services as **Azure Web Apps for Containers**
  (reusing the `K8sMesh/Service` image) discovered by resource **tag** via
  `Benzene.Mesh.Discovery.Azure`, plus a mesh Web App that serves the Mesh UI and persists the catalog
  to **Blob Storage** (`Benzene.Mesh.Azure.Blob`). `deploy/` is Terraform (App Service, storage,
  managed identity + role assignments). Has its own `README.md`.
- **`AzureFunctionsMesh/`** — the **purely Azure Functions** counterpart of `AzureMesh`: **six** Cloud
  Services (`orders`/`payments`/`shipping`/`inventory`/`notifications`/`analytics`, each its own Function
  App project, sharing `Shared/`) plus the mesh, each an isolated-worker **Function App**. The services
  **call each other over Service Bus (commands), Event Hub (fan-out stream) and Event Grid (routed
  events)** — the Azure counterpart of `AwsMesh`'s SQS/SNS/EventBridge topology; each `Triggers.cs`
  declares just the triggers it uses via the source generator. Services are HTTP-triggered too and expose
  the Cloud Service Profile via `UseBenzeneCloudService` (works because the Functions HTTP context is an
  `IHttpContext`); `host.json` clears the `/api` route prefix so `/benzene/*` sits at the root discovery
  expects. The mesh Function has an HTTP trigger (UI + artifacts + `/mesh/refresh`) and a **timer
  trigger** driving aggregation (the Consumption-plan replacement for the Web App's `BackgroundService`).
  Discovery is the **same** `Benzene.Mesh.Discovery.Azure` — a Function App is a `Microsoft.Web/sites`, so
  tagged Function Apps are found identically to Web Apps. Own `.sln`, `README.md`, and Terraform `deploy/`
  (zip-deployed Function Apps + Service Bus/Event Hub/Event Grid, no container registry; Event Grid
  subscriptions wired in a second apply after publish). Does **not** use the shared `App` domain.

## How these build (important)
- Examples build via **`Benzene.Examples.sln`** at the repo root — **not** the main `Benzene.sln`.
  Several folders also have their own solution (`Benzene.Example.Asp.sln`, `Benzene.Examples.Aws.sln`,
  `Benzene.Example.Azure.sln`, `Benzene.Example.Grpc.sln`, `Benzene.Example.Kafka.sln`).
- **The examples are NOT part of the primary CI gate.** `build-benzene.yml` builds `Benzene.sln` and the
  library tests only. The examples are exercised by the deploy workflows
  (`.github/workflows/deploy-asp-example.yml`, `deploy-aws-example.yml`) and otherwise by building
  `Benzene.Examples.sln` locally. So **a change here is not compile-checked by the main build** — if you
  edit an example, build `Benzene.Examples.sln` (or the relevant per-folder `.sln`) to verify it.
- Examples reference `src/` projects directly via `ProjectReference` (they track local source), not the
  published NuGet packages. Adding a new Benzene dependency to an example means adding a `ProjectReference`
  to the `src/` project.

## Conventions
- A new transport/host example: reference `Benzene.Examples.App` for the domain, add a `StartUp` that
  wires it onto the transport, and mirror the structure of an existing sibling (Asp/Aws are the fullest).
- Some example test projects exist (`*.Test` / `*.Tests`, and `*.Dev.Test` for tests needing a running
  dependency like localstack/kafka). Keep new example tests in the same shape.

## Known quirks — do not "tidy" casually
- **Inconsistent naming:** some folders use `Benzene.Example.*` (singular — Asp, Grpc, Azure) and others
  `Benzene.Examples.*` (plural — Aws, Google, Kafka, App, CodeGen, OpenTelemetry). Leave it unless asked;
  renaming a project touches its `.csproj`, every `.sln` that lists it, and every `ProjectReference` to it.
  (The former `Kakfa` misspelling under `examples/Kafka` was corrected to `Benzene.Examples.Kafka` /
  `Benzene.Examples.Kafka.Producer` — release plan 4.1.)

## Startup model
Host examples use the platform-neutral `BenzeneStartUp` (`Configure(IBenzeneApplicationBuilder app, …)`),
wired onto a transport inside `app.UseAwsLambda(…)` / `app.UseHttp(…)` / `app.UseWorker(…)` etc. The old
host-specific startup base classes (`AwsLambdaStartUp`, `BenzeneWorkerStartup`,
`BenzeneHostedServiceStartup`, and the example-local `AutofacAwsStartUp`) have been removed.
- **`Asp/Benzene.Example.Asp.Minimal`** — `StartUp : BenzeneStartUp` hosted via
  `WebApplicationBuilder.UseBenzene<StartUp>()` + `app.UseBenzene()` in `Program.cs`. The canonical ASP.NET
  reference for a newcomer.
- **`Asp/Benzene.Example.Asp`** — the one deliberate exception: it wires Benzene by hand with
  `IApplicationBuilder.UseBenzene(builder => builder.UseHttp(...))` rather than a `BenzeneStartUp`, because
  its controllers, Spec UI, and `app.Map("/protected", ...)` auth branch need native ASP.NET plumbing a
  `BenzeneStartUp.Configure(IBenzeneApplicationBuilder, …)` can't express. Its integration tests use
  ASP.NET Core's `WebApplicationFactory<Startup>`, which discovers that `Startup` class by convention.
- **`Aws/`** — `StartUp : BenzeneStartUp` hosted by `Function : AwsLambdaHost<StartUp>` (the Lambda handler
  entry point). Tests build the host with `BenzeneTestHost.Create<StartUp>().BuildAwsLambdaHost()`.
- **`Kafka/`** — `StartUp : BenzeneStartUp` run via `Host…UseBenzene<StartUp>()` (registers the worker as an
  `IHostedService`).

## Do NOT
- Do not modify `Benzene.Examples.sln` / the per-folder `.sln` structure without explicit approval.
- Do not add example projects to the main `Benzene.sln` — examples belong to `Benzene.Examples.sln`.
- Do not assume the main CI verifies example changes — it doesn't; build the examples solution yourself.
