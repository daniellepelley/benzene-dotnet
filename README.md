> **This is the .NET port of Benzene.** Benzene is defined by a language-neutral
> [specification](https://github.com/daniellepelley/Benzene/tree/main/docs/specification) that lives
> in the cross-language [`benzene`](https://github.com/daniellepelley/Benzene) repo, alongside the
> project website. This repo is the C# implementation of that spec — its packages, examples,
> templates, and .NET how-to docs. ".NET" is one language port; others translate the same spec.

**Benzene is a hexagonal (ports-and-adapters) framework for C# built
around a shared middleware pipeline — write your message handlers and
cross-cutting concerns (logging, correlation IDs, validation, health
checks) once, then run the same service behind AWS Lambda (API
Gateway, SQS, SNS, Kafka, EventBridge), Azure Functions (HTTP, Event
Hubs, Service Bus, Cosmos DB Change Feed, Queue/Blob Storage, Event
Grid, Timer), or ASP.NET Core without rewriting any of it.**

## Why Benzene?

- Write a message handler once, against a topic — swap the transport
  (HTTP, Lambda, SQS, SNS, Kafka...) without touching handler code
- Cross-cutting concerns (correlation IDs, logging, validation,
  health checks) live in composable middleware, not scattered across
  handlers
- New message handlers are discovered automatically by reflection —
  no manual routing tables to maintain
- Multi-cloud by design: the same handlers run on AWS, Azure, or a
  plain ASP.NET Core host
- Honest by design: Benzene abstracts your business logic, never the
  transport or the database — so you keep every cloud-native feature of
  the tools you chose (see the [Capability Matrix](docs/capability-matrix.md))
- Designed to outlive its .NET implementation: every concept, wire format, and
  status is written down independently of the C# API, so a future port to
  another language is a translation of a design, not a rewrite (see the
  [Benzene Specification](https://github.com/daniellepelley/Benzene/tree/main/docs/specification),
  the cross-language source of truth in the `benzene` repo)

## Quickstart

Benzene's packages are published as prerelease (`-alpha`) versions until 1.0, so
`--prerelease` is required:

```bash
dotnet add package Benzene.AspNet.Core --prerelease
```

A message handler, mapped to a topic:

```csharp
[Message("hello:world")]
[HttpEndpoint("GET", "/hello/{name}")]
public class HelloWorldMessageHandler : IMessageHandler<HelloWorldRequest, HelloWorldResponse>
{
    public Task<IBenzeneResult<HelloWorldResponse>> HandleAsync(HelloWorldRequest message)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(BenzeneResult.Ok(new HelloWorldResponse { Message = $"Hello {message.Name}!" }));
    }
}
```

Wired into an ASP.NET Core host (in `Program.cs`):

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.UsingBenzene(x => x
    .AddMessageHandlers(typeof(HelloWorldMessageHandler).Assembly));

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseBenzene(benzene => benzene
    .UseHttp(http => http
        .UseMessageHandlers()));

app.Run();
```

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for the full five-minute walkthrough (including
the request/response message types omitted above for brevity), and [`examples/`](./examples) for
complete, runnable sample projects covering AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, ASP.NET Core, Kafka, and
more.

## How it fits into hexagonal architecture

Your message handlers are the application core — they depend only on
`Benzene.Abstractions` types (`IMessageHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`,
`IBenzeneResult<T>`) and whatever port interfaces you define for your
own dependencies (databases, other services). Each transport
(`Benzene.AspNet.Core`, `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.*`, `Benzene.Azure.*`) is
an adapter that converts its native request into a message and routes
it to the matching handler via `UseMessageHandlers()`, then converts
the `IBenzeneResult` back into a transport-native response. Middleware
in `Benzene.Core.Middleware` provides the pipeline that every adapter
shares, so correlation IDs, logging, validation, and health checks are
written once and apply everywhere.

## Documentation

Full .NET documentation is available in [`docs/`](./docs), including:

- [Message Handlers](docs/message-handlers.md) and [Handler Results](docs/message-result.md)
- [Middleware](docs/middleware.md) and [Common Middleware](docs/common-middleware.md)
- [Testing Benzene](docs/testing-benzene.md)
- [Health Checks](docs/health-checks.md) and [Monitoring & Diagnostics](docs/monitoring.md)
- [AWS Lambda Setup](docs/getting-started-aws.md)
- [Azure Functions Setup](docs/azure-functions.md)
- [ASP.NET Core Integration](docs/asp-net-core.md)
- [Fluent Validation](docs/fluent-validation.md) and [Data Annotations](docs/data-annotations.md)
- [Terraform Code Generation](docs/terraform.md) and [OpenAPI/AsyncAPI Spec](docs/spec.md)
- [Correlation IDs](docs/correlation-ids.md)

The **language-neutral specification** (concepts, wire contracts, transport bindings, conformance
fixtures, porting guide) is not here — it is the cross-language source of truth and lives in the
[`benzene`](https://github.com/daniellepelley/Benzene/tree/main/docs/specification) repo. This
repo vendors a snapshot of the conformance fixtures under
[`test/conformance-fixtures/`](./test/conformance-fixtures) (kept in sync by the
`conformance-drift-check` CI job) so the test suite is self-contained.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Benzene.Core --prerelease
```

Plus whichever transport and integration packages your service needs
(`Benzene.AspNet.Core`, `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.ApiGateway`,
`Benzene.Azure.Function.Core`, `Benzene.FluentValidation`, etc.) — see
[`docs/`](./docs) for the relevant package per adapter.

Requires .NET 10.
