/// <see cref="CompositeMeshFleetReadModel"/>, alongside an <c>IMeshUsageSource</c> for stats and the

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Per-topic/service <em>counts</em> and service <em>health</em> are deliberately NOT on this
/// interface: traces are sampled (counts would be biased) and a trace store has no heartbeat feed.
/// Those come from their own sources. This is a trace / correlation / recent-flows reader.
