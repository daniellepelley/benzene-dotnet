> **2026-07-25 (cost round): `FleetQuery.IncludeFlows` — a wire COST HINT, not a contract change.**
> Absent/null ⇒ true (today's behavior). False means "I only need the windowed counts", so a plane that

> `GetRecentFlowsAsync` costs a `GetTraceSummaries` scan over the whole window, and X-Ray bills/free-tiers
> **traces scanned** (`Global-XRay-TracesAccessed`, 1M/month) separately from traces recorded — so the

## What this package does
The spec collector of `docs/specification/mesh.md` §4-§6 - an ordinary Benzene service
(dogfooded message handlers) that ingests the three mesh wire topics and answers the
`mesh:query:*` read models over an in-memory store. Together with `Benzene.Mesh.Wire` this makes
the .NET implementation cover the **full** mesh contract: it passes all three conformance
fixture files (`test/Benzene.Conformance.Test`), including `mesh-collector-cases.json`, and has
hosted a live cross-language fleet (Go and C# services in one view - see the roadmap's
2026-07-16 updates).

> **2026-07-24 (Phase D — time-range on the read seam).** The `mesh:query:*` read models take an optional
> `MeshTimeRange` (Grafana relative grammar `now`/`now-5m`/`now-1h`/`now-7d`, units s/m/h/d/w/M/y, or ISO-8601
> absolute — resolved by `MeshTimeRangeResolver` against server `now`). Added to `FleetQuery`/`ServiceQuery`/
> `TopicQuery`/`CorrelationQuery` (their new `Window` field) and threaded through `IMeshFleetReadModel`
> (`FleetAsync`/`ServiceAsync`/`TopicAsync`/`CorrelationAsync` gained `MeshTimeRange? range = null`) and
> `IMeshTraceSource` (`GetCorrelationAsync`/`GetRecentFlowsAsync`). **`mesh:query:trace` deliberately has no
> window** — a by-id lookup, and a window would only let a valid id outside the range answer `NotFound`.
> **Additive/backward-compatible:** a null range (or one with no `From`) means "unfiltered", exactly today's
> behavior, and the response's new `MeshWindow` field (`FleetView`/`ServiceView`/`TopicSummary`/`CorrelationView`,
> `WhenWritingNull`) is **omitted entirely** — so `mesh-collector-cases.json` and old clients are untouched (the
> default-1h window is a UI-picker default, never a wire default: the wire never silently hides pre-window flows).
> The honesty core is `MeshWindow.CountsWindowed`/`CountsSince`: **flows** (recent-flows/correlation) always honor
> the window, but **counts** may not — a windowed count that can't honor the window is *not* "absent" (that's the
> `MissingFeeds` "—" channel, for a dimension genuinely not produced), it's a real number answering a *different*
> window, so it's badged "counts cover from {CountsSince}", never blanked.
> - **Push-collector plane** (`MeshCollectorStore`): the ring is filtered by trace start for flows; the per-topic/
>   service counters are cumulative-since-start, so `CountsWindowed=false`, `CountsSince=StartedAtUtc`. Consumer-edge
>   derivation stays over the full bounded ring (already a recent window), not re-windowed — avoids a
>   windowed-consumers/cumulative-counts mismatch on one row.
> - **Composite plane** (`CompositeMeshFleetReadModel`): the range reaches the trace source (X-Ray/Tempo/Jaeger
>   `GetTraceSummaries`/search take it — flows honor it) **and** the usage sources — the picked window is resolved
>   to absolute and passed as a `MeshUsageWindow` to `IMeshUsageSource.FetchUsageAsync` (see the 2026-07-24
>   count-windowing note below). `CountsWindowed` is decided from what the sources **returned**: it's true only when
>   *every* contributing source echoed back a window matching the request (each windowable source queries its
>   backend over exactly those bounds), and false — with `CountsSince` = the earliest returned window start — if any
>   source couldn't (a cumulative source returns its own wider window). Honesty is never a source self-certifying.
>   All of this is verified by API shape (unit tests, mocked backends), NOT against a live AWS/Tempo/Jaeger backend.
> Covered by `MeshTimeRangeTest` (resolver grammar, store flow-windowing + `CountsSince`, null-window == today,
> composite range-threading, and the honored-vs-cumulative `CountsWindowed` decision).

> **2026-07-24 (Phase D fast-follow — composite counts honor the picked window).** `IMeshUsageSource.FetchUsageAsync`
> gained an optional `MeshUsageWindow?` (resolved absolute `[FromUtc,ToUtc]`, in `Benzene.Mesh.Contracts`; null =
> today's baked window, so the aggregator's `usage.json` path is unchanged). The **CloudWatch** and **App-Insights**
> adapters query their backend over exactly those bounds when given a window and echo it back on the returned
> `MeshUsage`; `CollectorUsageSource` **ignores** it (cumulative counters can't be sub-windowed) and keeps its
> since-start window. `CompositeMeshFleetReadModel` resolves the picked range, passes it to every usage source, and
> flips `CountsWindowed=true` only when all returned windows match the request within a 5-minute tolerance (absorbs a
> backend snapping to its aggregation period + clock skew; a cumulative source's much-earlier start clearly fails).
> Additive/backward-compatible: it's a new optional param on a public port (implemented by all three adapters — flag
> as a breaking-additive change). **Cost note:** on the composite plane a wider picked window now also drives the
> usage query — negligible for CloudWatch `GetMetricData` (billed per metric, not per datapoint) but real for Azure
> Log Analytics (billed on data scanned), so a 7d range raises the App-Insights query cost.

## Key types/interfaces
- `IMeshFleetReadModel` (2026-07-23) - the **read seam** the five `mesh:query:*` handlers depend on
  (async: `FleetAsync`/`ServiceAsync`/`TopicAsync`/`TraceAsync`/`CorrelationAsync`), so the fleet UI's
  data source is swappable. `MeshCollectorStore` implements it (explicit-interface async wrappers over
  its sync read methods — the push-collector plane, unchanged). Register `IMeshFleetReadModel` alongside
  the store singleton (every host that wires the collector now does both). The other implementation,
  `CompositeMeshFleetReadModel`, composes a pluggable `IMeshTraceSource` (OTel trace backend) with the
  `IMeshUsageSource`s (metrics backend) — see `work/otel-fleet-adapter-scope.md`.
- `IMeshTraceSource` (2026-07-23) - the pluggable trace-shaped source (`GetTraceAsync` /
  `GetCorrelationAsync` / `GetRecentFlowsAsync`) implemented per backend in a `Benzene.Mesh.Fleet.*`
  adapter (X-Ray first). Deliberately carries **no** stats/health (traces are sampled; no heartbeat
  feed) — those stay `IMeshUsageSource` + the heartbeat plane. `GetRecentFlowsAsync` returns per-flow
  `TraceSummary` rows only (no aggregate counts), and its `Events` may be 0 when the backend's summary
  shape has no span count (the accurate count is one `GetTraceAsync` away on drill-in).
- `CompositeMeshFleetReadModel` (2026-07-23) - the backend-composed `IMeshFleetReadModel` (inc 3):
  **topic stats** from the `IMeshUsageSource`s (CloudWatch/App Insights), **recent flows + the
  anonymous-but-live service list** from the `IMeshTraceSource` (X-Ray). Each source is fetched in its
  own try/catch (the aggregator's fetch-isolation rule — one failing source degrades its own slice to
  empty, never blanks the whole `FleetView`). Per-service pages and single-topic rows return `null` (no
  descriptor feed on this plane). Two honesty details worth knowing:
  - **Error rule follows the metric `result` vocabulary, NOT the wire-status classifiers.** A usage
    entry's `status` is the `result` tag (`docs/mesh-usage-feed.md` §1): `success` collapses every
    ok/created/…, `exception`/`failure` are error buckets with no wire status, `not-found`/… are
    itemized failures, `<missing>`/null are no-outcome. So "error" = `status is not null && != "success"
    && != "<missing>"`. Do **not** rewrite this as `BenzeneResultStatus.IsFailure`/`!IsSuccess` — those
    read the *wire* vocabulary (what the push-collector's raw trace `benzene.status` carries, a
    different vocabulary) and would miscount `exception`/`failure` as non-errors and `success` as an error.
  - **Absent ≠ zero.** CloudWatch has no per-service dimension and no duration, and X-Ray traces are
    sampled, so genuinely-absent stats are marked via `MissingFeeds` (below), not shown as `0`: topic
    rows carry `["descriptor","duration"]` (Providers need a descriptor feed; duration unless a usage
    source measured it), anonymous service rows carry `["descriptor","health","stats"]`.
- `MeshCollectorStore` - the in-memory state (singleton per collector): cumulative per-service
  and per-topic stats, latest heartbeat per instance, registered descriptors, and a bounded ring
  of recent trace events (default 4096). Consumer edges are derived **at query time** from ring
  parentage - an event whose parent span belongs to another service makes that service a
  consumer of the event's topic; who-calls-whom is observed, never declared. Re-registration
  replaces a service's provider edges wholesale (a redeploy that drops a topic drops the claim).
- `MeshCollectorHandlers.All` - the eight handlers to pass to `UseMessageHandlers`:
  `mesh:register`/`mesh:heartbeat`/`mesh:traces` ingest (service required → `BadRequest`; an
  empty trace batch is accepted) and `mesh:query:fleet`/`service`/`topic`/`trace`/`correlation`
  (missing params → `BadRequest`, unknown subjects → `NotFound`).
- `MeshCollectorHandlers.Queries` (2026-07-23) - the five `mesh:query:*` handlers only, no ingest. For a
  host whose fleet read model is composed from an external backend (a `Benzene.Mesh.Fleet.*` adapter,
  e.g. X-Ray) rather than the push collector: there's no ring to ingest into, only an
  `IMeshFleetReadModel` to query. The query handlers depend solely on `IMeshFleetReadModel`, so no
  `MeshCollectorStore` singleton is needed with this list.
- `mesh:query:correlation` (`CorrelationQueryMessageHandler`, 2026-07-23) - cross-service failure
  triage from a **business correlation id** (a ticket/log id) rather than a trace id. A correlation
  id can span multiple traces, so `MeshCollectorStore.Correlation(id)` filters the ring by
  `MeshTraceEvent.CorrelationId` (already a shipped wire field, populated from `x-correlation-id`),
  groups by trace id, and returns `CorrelationView { CorrelationId; List<TraceView> Traces }` - one
  ordinary single-trace `TraceView` per matching trace (events in start order, traces ordered by
  earliest start), so the fleet UI renders each through the **same waterfall** as a normal trace.
  Events with a null correlation id never match (the mesh never fabricates one); empty id →
  `BadRequest`, nothing matched → `NotFound`. **Additive/read-model only** - no wire, ingestion, or
  spec change. Query surface is not yet conformance-pinned across languages (no Go-reference case
  yet); shipped .NET-side, a fixture case + Go collector are the fast-follow. Covered by
  `MeshCollectorStoreTest`'s correlation cases.
- View shapes (`FleetView`, `ServiceSummary`, `TopicSummary`, `ServiceView`, `InstanceView`,
  `TraceView`, `TraceSummary`, `CorrelationView`, `Ack`) - `ServiceSummary.missingFeeds` names what the
  collector hasn't received per service ("descriptor"/"health"/"traces"); `TopicSummary.missingFeeds`
  (2026-07-23, additive) does the same at the topic grain, naming absent **stat dimensions**
  ("descriptor"/"duration"/"stats") so a backend-composed reader can mark a genuinely-absent count/duration
  and the UI renders "—" not "0" (empty on the push-collector plane, which observes every dimension —
  the fixtures' subset match ignores the extra key). `hashMatches` surfaces an instance running a
  different contract than its registration; health is `healthy`/`degraded`/`unknown` from the
  latest heartbeats. `TraceSummary.topic` (2026-07-25, additive, `WhenWritingNull`-omitted — drains-up
  phase 1) is the flow's **entry topic** (the earliest Benzene event's), so the fleet UI can attribute a
  flow (and its failure) to a topic without a per-row trace fetch; populated by the store's ring
  summaries, the X-Ray adapter's enriched rows, and Jaeger — null on a summary-plane row that mapped no
  Benzene spans (which is itself signal: a failing flow with no topic is the "uninstrumented failure"
  inbox class).
- `CollectorUsageSource : Benzene.Mesh.Contracts.IMeshUsageSource` (2026-07-22) - the
  collector→aggregator usage bridge, the "`IMeshArtifactStore` bridge to the aggregator pipeline"
  extension point below made real for the usage feed (`docs/mesh-usage-feed.md`). Reports the
  store's cumulative per-topic stats as one `MeshUsageEntry` per (topic, version, status), window
  = since `MeshCollectorStore.StartedAtUtc` (in-memory stats are cumulative since process start).
  `Transport`/`Service` are deliberately `null` - the trace wire shape carries no transport, and
  per-status counts aren't attributed per handling service - so a collector-fed `usage.json`
  exercises the UI's missing-dimension degradation path honestly rather than guessing. Register
  it alongside `AddMeshAggregator` in a host that also runs the collector's handlers (they share
  the singleton store). Never returns `null`: an idle collector is a wired feed with an empty
  entries array, not an absent one. This added the package's `Benzene.Mesh.Contracts` reference.

## Important conventions
- **Degradation is normative (spec §6, collector side)**: partial fleets are accepted and
  rendered as reduced - traces from an unregistered service create an anonymous-but-live row,
  a registered service with no traffic is a catalog entry with no stats, and no missing feed
  ever fails ingestion or a query.
- The query shapes are asserted by `mesh-collector-cases.json` as the observable surface for
  the ingest/derivation rules; treat them as fixture-pinned even though the spec doesn't promote
  them as cross-port contracts yet (spec §4's note).
- Cumulative stats deliberately outlive the trace ring window; the fleet flow list caps at 20,
  newest first (`test/Benzene.Mesh.Test/MeshCollectorStoreTest.cs` pins these).
- Storage is in-memory by design for this tier (a restart re-learns the fleet from the next
  heartbeats/traces). A durable store or an `IMeshArtifactStore` bridge to the
  `Benzene.Mesh.Aggregator` pipeline is the natural extension point, not a rewrite.

## Dependencies on other Benzene packages
- **Benzene.Mesh.Wire** - the wire shapes it ingests.
- **Benzene.Mesh.Contracts** - `IMeshUsageSource`/`MeshUsage` for `CollectorUsageSource`.
- **Benzene.Core.MessageHandlers** / **Abstractions.MessageHandlers** - handler idiom.
- **Benzene.Results** - statuses (the wire-contracts §3 success class drives error counting).
