# Benzene.Clients

## What this package does
Client abstractions for calling Benzene services. Provides interfaces and base implementations for building type-safe clients that communicate with Benzene HTTP endpoints and message handlers.

## Key types/interfaces

### Batch send (current, 2026-07-20)
Shared abstractions for the per-transport batch clients (`SqsBatchMessageClient`,
`SnsBatchMessageClient`, `EventBridgeBatchMessageClient`, `ServiceBusBatchMessageClient`,
`EventHubBatchMessageClient`, `EventGridBatchMessageClient` in the `Benzene.Clients.*` transport
packages) — design §30.1 of `work/designs/medium-fixes-design.md`:
- `IBenzeneBatchMessageClient` (`: IDisposable`) — `Task<BatchSendResult> SendBatchAsync<TRequest>(IReadOnlyCollection<IBenzeneClientRequest<TRequest>> requests)`.
  A **separate** interface from `IBenzeneMessageClient` so the single-send path is untouched; a
  transport client can implement either or both. Batch send is fire-and-forget with per-entry
  acknowledgement — no typed response, only which entries failed.
- `BatchSendResult` — `IReadOnlyList<FailedBatchEntry> Failures` + `bool AllSucceeded`.
  `FailedBatchEntry` carries the failed request's `Index` (its position in the caller's collection)
  plus the provider's `ErrorCode`/`ErrorMessage`, so the caller can retry exactly the failed subset.
- `BatchSend.Chunk<T>(items, chunkSize)` — splits a collection into provider-sized chunks pairing
  each item with its original index, for the AWS clients (SQS/SNS/EventBridge ≤10) and Event Grid.
- **Failure granularity differs by provider.** AWS (SQS/SNS/EventBridge) report per-entry
  success/failure, so `Failures` names exactly the entries the provider rejected. The Azure batch
  primitives (`ServiceBusMessageBatch`, `EventDataBatch`, Event Grid `SendEventsAsync`) are **atomic
  per send** — no per-entry ack — so a failed batch/chunk send reports *every* message in that
  batch as failed. Each transport's `CLAUDE.md` states which model it uses.

### Outbound routing (current, 2026-07-17)
The outbound mechanism from `work/benzene-clients-redesign-plan.md` - a single topic-keyed
pipeline table. See that document for the full design and its now-complete 4-step migration plan
(all four steps shipped 2026-07-17; the old service-name/topic-key factory + decorator-chain
mechanism this replaced has been deleted, not just deprecated - see "Legacy outbound mechanism"
below for what to reach for instead if you're migrating old code).
`Benzene.CodeGen.Client`'s generated clients target it, and `Benzene.Clients.Aws`'s SQS/SNS
transports (and the cross-cutting middleware below) are wired onto it - `.UseAwsLambda(...)` is
explicitly deferred (see that package's `CLAUDE.md`).

### Outbound middleware (current, 2026-07-17)
The middleware-ification of the old `ClientBuilder`/`IDependencyWrapper<T>` decorators, for use on
an `OutboundRoutingBuilder.Route(...)` pipeline:
- **Retry** - no new type needed. `Benzene.Resilience.RetryMiddleware<TContext>`/
  `.UseRetry<TContext>(...)` (already existed, fully generic) works on `OutboundContext` unmodified -
  pass `shouldRetryContext: ctx => ((IBenzeneResult)ctx.Response).IsServiceUnavailable() || ...`
  to match `RetryBenzeneMessageClient`'s old default retry predicate.
- `CorrelationIdMiddleware` (`Benzene.Clients.CorrelationId`) / `.UseCorrelationId(correlationKey = "correlationId")` -
  stamps the current `ICorrelationId.Get()` value onto `OutboundContext.Headers`. Converted from
  `CorrelationIdBenzeneMessageClient`.
- `W3CTraceContextMiddleware` (`Benzene.Clients.TraceContext`) / `.UseW3CTraceContext()` - stamps
  `Activity.Current`'s `traceparent`/`tracestate` onto `OutboundContext.Headers`. Converted from
  `TraceContextBenzeneMessageClient`. Same method name as `Benzene.Diagnostics.UseW3CTraceContext<TContext>()`
  (the *inbound* trace-context-extraction middleware) - no collision since one's generic and one's
  a concrete `OutboundContext` overload, but don't confuse the two; they run in opposite directions.
- No dedicated `HeadersMiddleware` - unnecessary. `IBenzeneMessageSender.SendAsync`'s per-call
  `headers` parameter (see above) already closes the "ambient mutable header state" concern
  structurally, without a decorator.
- `IBenzeneMessageSender` - the one interface business logic depends on:
  `SendAsync<TRequest,TResponse>(topic, request, headers = null)`. No service name, no client type,
  no factory resolution at the call site. `headers` is optional per-call metadata (e.g. a
  caller-supplied correlation/tenant value) - **note this is one deviation from the design doc's
  §2.1 two-arg snippet**, added while implementing Step 2 because the pre-existing generated
  client's public API already had a real per-call headers overload that migrating away from
  `IBenzeneMessageClientFactory` would otherwise have silently dropped.
- `OutboundContext` - the outbound pipeline context: `Topic`, `Request`, `Headers` (per-call, never
  null), and a settable `Response` slot. Deliberately non-generic, matching every other
  `IMiddleware<TContext>` in this codebase.
- `OutboundRoutingBuilder` / `AddOutboundRouting(...)` - builds one `IMiddlewarePipeline<OutboundContext>`
  per topic via `.Route(topic, pipeline => ...)`; `Build()` throws `DuplicateOutboundRouteException`
  for a repeated topic. `AddOutboundRouting(...)` registers the resulting `IBenzeneMessageSender`
  plus an `OutboundRoutingTopics` singleton (the registered topic set, for `ValidateOutboundRouting()` below).
- `OutboundParallelExtensions.UseParallel(...)` / `ParallelOutboundMiddleware` (internal) - fans **one
  message out to several transports concurrently** within a single route:
  `p.UseParallel(("sqs", b => b.UseSqs(url)), ("sns", b => b.UseSns(arn)))`. Needed because a
  transport middleware (`ContextConverterMiddleware`, "Convert") is **terminal** - it never calls
  `next` - so a single route otherwise holds a single transport, and even two chained would run in
  turn. `UseParallel` builds each branch as its own single-transport sub-pipeline
  (`CreateMiddlewarePipeline`), runs them on **cloned** `OutboundContext`s (the copy keeps the branches
  from racing the shared `Headers`/`Response`), awaits them together via `BoundedFanOut` (optional
  `maxDegreeOfParallelism`), and aggregates **all-must-succeed**: `IBenzeneResult<Void>` success only
  if every branch succeeded, otherwise a single failure whose `Errors` name each failed transport
  (a branch that throws is caught so the others still run). It's a terminal send step, like the
  transports it fans out to. From the AWS X-Ray perf analysis: sequential SQS+SNS sends (6.5ms +
  18.6ms) collapse to ~max. (Note: sending *different* messages to *different* topics is still just
  `Task.WhenAll` over two `SendAsync` calls at the app level - `UseParallel` is specifically one
  message → many transports.) Tests: `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/ParallelOutboundTest.cs`.
- `DefaultBenzeneMessageSender` (internal) - resolves a topic to its pipeline and runs it; throws
  `UnroutedTopicException` for a topic with no registered route. If the route's response isn't an
  `IBenzeneResult<TResponse>` for the caller's requested `TResponse` - the common case being a
  send-acknowledgement-only transport (SQS/SNS/Service Bus/Event Hubs/Event Grid/Queue Storage)
  whose route always produces `IBenzeneResult<Void>` regardless of what `TResponse` was asked for -
  it throws `OutboundResponseTypeMismatchException` naming the topic, the actual response type, and
  the requested one (release plan Tier 2.4; replaced a bare `InvalidCastException` at this exact
  call site that named neither).
- `ValidateOutboundRouting()` (on `IServiceResolver`) - per design §2.5: reflects over every loaded
  assembly for a type carrying `[OutboundRoutingContract]` (`OutboundRoutingContractAttribute`, this
  package) that also has a public static `string[] RequiredTopics` field (what
  `Benzene.CodeGen.Client`'s generated `{Service}ServiceClientRouting` classes emit) and throws
  `MissingOutboundRoutesException` listing every required topic with no registered route. Opt-in -
  call once, typically right after resolving `IBenzeneMessageSender`. The scan is **attribute-gated**
  (2026-07-21): a type is only inspected when it carries `[OutboundRoutingContract]`, so an unrelated
  type that merely happens to declare a `RequiredTopics` field is no longer swept in. **One behavior
  change**: a hand-rolled `*Routing` holder that relied on the old field-name-only scan must now also
  carry `[OutboundRoutingContract]` to be discovered (generated clients already emit it, so codegen
  consumers need no change). **Caveat for test authors**: the reflection scan is still global
  (`AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()`), so the cross-test pollution is now largely resolved -
  a stray `RequiredTopics` field no longer leaks. An *attributed* test-local `*Routing` type still
  stays loaded and visible to every other `ValidateOutboundRouting()` call for the rest of that test
  process once JIT-touched, so keep test holders' topics namespaced - see
  `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/ValidateOutboundRoutingTest.cs`'s `OrderServiceClientRouting`
  (attributed, discovered) and `PhantomServiceClientRouting` (unattributed, proven ignored).
- Transport-specific route-registration extensions on the outbound pipeline builder **now exist**:
  `.UseSqs(...)` / `.UseSns(...)` are the `IMiddlewarePipelineBuilder<OutboundContext>` overloads in
  **`Benzene.Clients.Aws`** (`Sqs/Extensions.cs`, `Sns/Extensions.cs`), and `.UseEventBridge(...)` is
  the same overload in **`Benzene.Clients.Aws.EventBridge`** (`Extensions.cs`, added 2026-07-22 via
  `OutboundEventBridgeContextConverter` - topic → `DetailType`, `source`/`eventBusName` args, default-on
  dependency health check) - none in this package, since they carry the AWS SDK dependency. The
  cross-cutting middleware (`.UseRetry(...)` from `Benzene.Resilience`, `.UseCorrelationId(...)`,
  `.UseW3CTraceContext()`) are the ones documented under "Outbound middleware" above. Only
  `.UseAwsLambda(...)` on the `OutboundContext` builder remains deferred (see `Benzene.Clients.Aws`'s
  `CLAUDE.md`).

### Benzene.CodeGen.Client generated clients (current, 2026-07-17)
`MessageClientSdkBuilder` (in `Benzene.CodeGen.Client`, not this package, but documented here since
it's the primary consumer of the outbound routing mechanism above) now generates against
`IBenzeneMessageSender` instead of `IBenzeneMessageClientFactory`: the generated
`{Service}ServiceClient`'s constructor takes `IBenzeneMessageSender sender`, and every generated
`XAsync(message, headers)` method body is `return _sender.SendAsync<TRequest,TResponse>("topic", message, headers);`
- no more per-call `using (var client = _clientFactory.Create(...))`. Each generated client also
now emits a sibling `{Service}ServiceClientRouting` static class - carrying
`[OutboundRoutingContract]` (2026-07-21) - with a `RequiredTopics` array (every request topic plus
`"healthcheck"`), for `ValidateOutboundRouting()` above. The generated
*interface* (`I{Service}ServiceClient`) is unchanged - this is purely an implementation-detail
change in the generated class body.

### Legacy outbound mechanism (deleted 2026-07-17, Step 4 of the migration plan)
The alpha-era service-name/topic-key factory + decorator-chain mechanism - `ClientsBuilder`,
`SingleClientsBuilder`, `IBenzeneMessageClientFactory`, `IClientMessageRouter`,
`IDependencyWrapper<T>` (`Benzene.Abstractions`), `DependencyWrapperFactory<T>`, `ClientBuilder`,
`BenzeneMessageClientFactory`, `RetryBenzeneMessageClient`/`RetryBenzeneMessageClientWrapper`,
`HeaderBenzeneMessageClient`/`HeadersBenzeneMessageClient`, `CorrelationIdBenzeneMessageClient`/
`CorrelationIdBenzeneMessageClientWrapper`, `TraceContextBenzeneMessageClient`/
`TraceContextBenzeneMessageClientWrapper`, `ClientMessageSender<TRequest,TResponse>`,
`ClientMapping`, `ClientMappingBuilder`, `TopicAndServiceKey`, `IClientHeaders`, `ClientHeaders` -
**has been deleted entirely**, after one release cycle as `[Obsolete]`. See
`work/benzene-clients-redesign-plan.md`'s 2026-07-17 Step 4 scope-correction update for the full
old→new mapping and what was verified safe to delete. **Untouched**:
`IBenzeneMessageClient` itself and its concrete transport implementations
(`SqsBenzeneMessageClient`, `SnsBenzeneMessageClient`, `AwsLambdaBenzeneMessageClient`,
`EventBridgeBenzeneMessageClient`, `GrpcBenzeneMessageClient`, `KafkaBenzeneMessageClient`) -
`IBenzeneMessageClient` is shared foundation for `Benzene.Grpc.Client`/`Benzene.Kafka.Core`,
entirely outside this redesign's scope, and was never obsoleted.

## When to use this package
- When building clients for Benzene services
- For type-safe service communication
- When generating API clients
- Foundation for specific client implementations

## Dependencies on other Benzene packages
- **Benzene.Abstractions.Messages** - `IBenzeneClientRequest<T>`, client message contracts
- **Benzene.Core.Middleware** - `MiddlewarePipelineBuilder<TContext>`, for `OutboundRoutingBuilder`'s
  per-topic pipelines (added 2026-07-17 for the outbound routing redesign above)
- **Benzene.Results** - `IBenzeneResult`/status mapping (`BenzeneResultHttpMapper`)

## Important conventions
- Type-safe request/response
- Async client methods
- Transport-agnostic interface
- Used by HTTP and AWS clients

## Tests
- `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/OutboundRoutingBuilderTest.cs` - one pipeline per topic,
  duplicate-topic throws `DuplicateOutboundRouteException`, no routes -> empty table.
- `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/DefaultBenzeneMessageSenderTest.cs` - routes to the right topic's
  pipeline and returns its response, two topics don't cross-contaminate, unrouted topic throws
  `UnroutedTopicException`. Exercises `DefaultBenzeneMessageSender` (internal, no
  `InternalsVisibleTo` wiring in this repo) through `AddOutboundRouting` + the resolved
  `IBenzeneMessageSender` instead of a direct unit test.
- `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/ValidateOutboundRoutingTest.cs` - all required topics routed
  doesn't throw; a missing required topic throws `MissingOutboundRoutesException` naming exactly
  the missing one.
- `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Autogen/CodeGen/Client/MessageClientSdkBuilderTest.cs` - golden-file
  coverage for the generated `{Service}ServiceClient`/`{Service}ServiceClientRouting` output
  (`test/Benzene.Core.Test/Autogen/CodeGen/Client/Examples/*.txt`).
- `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/W3CTraceContextMiddlewareTest.cs` /
  `CorrelationIdMiddlewareTest.cs` - the two outbound cross-cutting middleware directly (an ambient
  `Activity`/`ICorrelationId` value gets stamped onto `OutboundContext.Headers`; no ambient value
  leaves headers unchanged).
- `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/Aws/Sqs/OutboundSqsContextConverterTest.cs` /
  `Aws/Sns/OutboundSnsContextConverterTest.cs` - `.UseSqs(...)`/`.UseSns(...)` routed end to end
  through `AddOutboundRouting` + the resolved `IBenzeneMessageSender`: the mocked AWS client
  receives the right queue/topic, serialized body, `topic` message attribute, and forwarded
  per-call headers; the result maps `HttpStatusCode.OK` to `BenzeneResultStatus.Ok`.
