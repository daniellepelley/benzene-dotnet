# Benzene.Http

## What this package does
Provides HTTP abstractions and utilities for building HTTP-based Benzene applications. Includes HTTP context, request/response handling, routing, endpoint discovery, CORS middleware, and status code mapping. Foundation for all HTTP transport adapters (AspNet.Core, Lambda API Gateway, etc.).

## Key types/interfaces

### HTTP Context & Request
- `IHttpContext` - HTTP request/response context
- `HttpRequest` - Simple HTTP request representation
- `IHttpRequestAdapter<TContext>` - Adapts transport context to HTTP

### Routing
- `IHttpEndpointDefinition` - Metadata for HTTP endpoints
- `IHttpEndpointFinder` - Discovers HTTP endpoints
- `IListHttpEndpointFinder` - List-based endpoint finder
- `IRouteFinder` - Finds routes by HTTP method and path
- `HttpEndpointDefinition` - Concrete endpoint definition
- `HttpTopicRoute` - Route with topic/message name
- `UrlMatcher` - Matches URLs with route patterns (delegates to `CompiledRoutePath`)
- `CompiledRoutePath` (internal) - a route pattern with its per-segment split/regex parsing done
  once, up front, so matching an incoming path is cheap string comparisons rather than re-splitting
  the pattern and running `Regex.Split` over it per request
- `RouteFinder` - Default route finder implementation; compiles each route's method (lower-cased) and
  path (to a `CompiledRoutePath`) once at construction, and splits only the incoming path per request
  (once, not once per route), so the hot path does no per-route regex/splitting work

### Path-based versioning (opt-in)
- `HttpVersioningOptions` - policy: `VersionSegment` (default `v{version}` → `/v1/…`), `KeepUnversionedRoute`
  (default true - the bare route stays and resolves to the latest handler via the version selector).
  `VersionParameterName` = `"version"`, matching what `HttpMessageVersionGetterBase` reads.
- `VersionedHttpEndpointFinder` - decorates `IHttpEndpointFinder`: re-emits each discovered route under the
  version segment (and, by default, keeps the unversioned twin), so `/v1/orders` and `/orders` both reach the
  same topic; a route the app already declared with `{version}` is a hand-authored override, passed through
  untouched. Dedups on (method, path).
- `Extensions.AddHttpVersioning(configure?)` - opt-in wiring: replaces the (now concretely-registered)
  `CompositeHttpEndpointFinder` with the decorator. Off unless called. Because both `RouteFinder` and the
  spec builder read `IHttpEndpointFinder`, the versioned paths flow into routing **and** the generated spec
  (so the mesh sees per-version endpoints) with no per-transport change. Call after `AddHttpMessageHandlers`.
  The version the route captures (e.g. `/v2/…` → `"2"`) is the same token the `benzene-version` header and the
  payload casters use - see `Benzene.Core.Versioning` and `docs/specification/versioning.md`.

### Endpoint Discovery
- `ReflectionHttpEndpointFinder` - Discovers endpoints via reflection
- `CacheHttpEndpointFinder` - Caches discovered endpoints
- `CompositeHttpEndpointFinder` - Combines multiple finders
- `DependencyHttpEndpointFinder` - Discovers from DI container
- `ListHttpEndpointFinder` - Manual endpoint list
- `UnroutedHttpEndpointCheck` - fail-fast diagnostic wired first in `AddHttpMessageHandlers`'
  composite: contributes no endpoints, but throws a `BenzeneException` when a scanned handler type
  (from `MessageHandlerCandidateTypes`, recorded by Core's `AddMessageHandlers(Type[])`) carries
  `[HttpEndpoint]` but no `[Message]` and no explicit registration — handler discovery skips such
  types, so the route would otherwise just silently not exist (a 404 with no hint why). Explicitly
  registered handlers (`AddMessageHandler<THandler,...>("topic")`) appear among the discovered
  definitions and are not flagged; abstract types are ignored.

### Status Codes
- `IHttpStatusCodeMapper` - Maps result status to HTTP status codes
- `DefaultHttpStatusCodeMapper` - Default HTTP status mapping
- `HttpStatusCodeResponseHandler<TContext>` - Sets HTTP status on response

### Headers
- `IHttpHeaderMappings` - Maps custom headers to constants
- `HttpHeaderMappings` - Header mapping implementation
- `DefaultHttpHeaderMappings` - Default header mappings

### BenzeneMessage over HTTP (`BenzeneMessage/`)
The HTTP equivalent of the direct AWS Lambda invoke path — same `UseBenzeneMessage` name and
overload shapes (inline `Action<IMiddlewarePipelineBuilder<BenzeneMessageContext>>` or a shared
pre-built builder).
- `BenzeneMessageHttpMiddleware<TContext> where TContext : IHttpContext` - on POST to its path,
  deserializes a `BenzeneMessageRequest` envelope from the body (via `IMessageBodyGetter<TContext>`),
  runs it through a `BenzeneMessageApplication` (the `"benzene"` transport — routing, validation,
  middleware, handler), and writes the response envelope as `application/json` with the HTTP status
  mapped via `IHttpStatusCodeMapper`; anything else falls through to `next`. Same short-circuit
  shape as `CorsMiddleware`/`SpecUiMiddleware`, so it works on every HTTP transport. The envelope
  is always read/written with Benzene's default JSON serialization, independent of the app's own
  negotiated payload formats.
- `BenzeneMessageHttpOptions` - `Path` (default `/benzene-message`) and optional `TopicFilter`
  allowlist predicate (rejected topic → `NotFound` envelope, 404).
- `IBenzeneMessageHttpEndpointInfo` - registered by `UseBenzeneMessage` so the `benzene` spec
  builder (`Benzene.Schema.OpenApi`) can advertise the endpoint as the top-level `messageEndpoint`
  field, which the Spec UI's try-it panel feature-detects.
- **Security posture:** the endpoint exposes every routed topic (including ones with no HTTP
  mapping) — strictly opt-in, intended for local dev/admin environments; compose auth middleware
  in front and/or use `TopicFilter`. See `docs/payload-testing.md`.
- Tests: `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Http/BenzeneMessageHttpMiddlewareTest.cs` (unit, Moq'd adapters)
  and `BenzeneMessageHttpPipelineTest.cs` (end-to-end through an API Gateway test host).

### CORS
Behavior tracks the CORS spec the same way `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors` does (exact origin
matching, credential-safe wildcards, preflight header validation, Vary caching hint).
- `CorsSettings` - CORS configuration:
  - `AllowedDomains` - full URLs match exactly on scheme+host+port; bare hostnames match host only
    (any scheme/port); `"*"` allows any origin
  - `AllowedHeaders` - explicit list, or `"*"` to allow any header (`AllowAnyHeader()` equivalent)
  - `ExposedHeaders` - sets `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` on actual (non-preflight) responses
  - `AllowCredentials`/`MaxAgeSeconds` - control `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`/`Access-Control-Max-Age`
- `CorsMiddleware<TContext>` - CORS middleware; sets `Vary: Origin` on every response it processes.
  A **preflight** is detected the way the Fetch standard defines it: an `OPTIONS` request carrying
  `Access-Control-Request-Method`. Only a preflight response carries the preflight-only headers
  (`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, `Access-Control-Max-Age`); an
  actual (non-preflight) response carries only `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`,
  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` and `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` (a browser ignores the
  preflight-only headers elsewhere). A preflight is rejected (no CORS headers at all) when its
  `Access-Control-Request-Headers` includes a header outside a non-wildcard `AllowedHeaders` list
- `CorsOriginChecker` - Validates CORS origins; always echoes the actual `Origin` value (never a
  literal `"*"`), which is what makes a *specific* origin allow-list + credentials safe to combine.
  A wildcard (`"*"`) origin + credentials is refused, not reflected: when `AllowedDomains` contains
  `"*"` the middleware omits `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` (matching ASP.NET Core, which throws
  on `AllowAnyOrigin()` + `AllowCredentials()`) so a credentialed response can't leak to any origin

### Request body buffering (`RequestBody/`)
Removes the sync-over-async block from the stream-reading HTTP body getters (ASP.NET Core, Azure
Functions ASP.NET, self-hosted HttpListener), which used to call `ReadToEndAsync().Result` /
`ReadToEnd()` and tie up a thread-pool thread per request.
- `HttpRequestBodyBuffer` - scoped, per-request holder for a body already read from the stream
  (`IsBuffered`/`Body`/`Set`). Same "scoped DI state, not context" pattern as `PresetTopicHolder`:
  the context type stays a pure message description, this per-request state lives in the scope.
- `IHttpRequestBodyReader<TContext>` - transport-specific async body reader; each stream-based
  transport's body getter implements it (`Task<string?> ReadBodyAsync(context)`).
- `BufferRequestBodyMiddleware<TContext>` - front-of-pipeline middleware that awaits
  `IHttpRequestBodyReader<TContext>.ReadBodyAsync` once and stores the result in the scoped buffer,
  so the synchronous `IMessageBodyGetter<TContext>.GetBody` serves it from memory (no thread block).
- `BufferRequestBodyExtensions.UseBufferedRequestBody<TContext>()` - wires the middleware. Each HTTP
  transport auto-adds it as the first middleware in its `UseHttp(...)`, so existing apps get the
  non-blocking read with no code change. If the middleware isn't wired, `GetBody` falls back to the
  original synchronous read, so the behavior is identical either way. Note: the body is read up front
  (before other pipeline middleware); the ASP.NET readers call `EnableBuffering()` so anything
  downstream can still re-read `Request.Body`.
