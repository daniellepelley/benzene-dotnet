/// error code), so the same denial classifies identically whether the SDK returns 403 or - like AWS
/// EventBridge's <c>AccessDeniedException</c> - HTTP 400. This is safe because the deep <c>healthcheck</c>
/// layer (the only one that harvests dependency checks, and the status the Mesh UI renders) is
/// <b>advisory</b>: <c>liveness</c>/<c>readiness</c> exclude dependency checks, so a red here can never
/// de-service a pod or de-register a load balancer target - it tells a human the estate is not wired up as
/// expected. So surfacing an authorization denial as red is a true, useful signal, not a false alarm.
/// (Reversal of the earlier §3.9 rule, which made a permission error a Warning so a least-privilege publisher
