/// One rule for turning a handler's response into a follow-up event. Registered per pipeline via

/// that resolves a publication publishes (fan-out is allowed).
/// The metadata properties exist so mappings are introspectable as plain data - via
/// <see cref="IResponseEventCatalog"/> at runtime and spec generation
/// (<c>IMessageDefinitionFinder</c>) at build time. Convention-based rules that derive topics at
/// runtime return <c>null</c> metadata; explicit mappings should populate it.
