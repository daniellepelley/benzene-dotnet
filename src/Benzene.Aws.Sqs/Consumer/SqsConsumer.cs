/// <remarks>
/// Uses long polling (<see cref="SqsConsumerConfig.WaitTimeSeconds"/>) in a loop until
/// <see cref="StartAsync"/>'s cancellation token is signaled. By default
/// (<see cref="SqsConsumerAckMode.PerMessage"/>), only the messages whose handler reported an explicit
/// success are deleted; a message that fails, throws, or is unrouted is left on the queue individually
/// for redelivery/DLQ redrive, regardless of the other messages in the same batch. Pass
/// <see cref="SqsConsumerOptions"/> with <see cref="SqsConsumerAckMode.WholeBatch"/> for the older
/// all-or-nothing-on-throw behavior (the whole batch is deleted together, only once every message has
/// run without throwing). A poll iteration that throws for a reason other than cancellation (e.g. a
/// transient AWS error) is logged and the loop continues after a capped, geometrically-growing backoff
/// (reset on the next successful receive), rather than the exception propagating out and permanently
/// ending the worker - or a persistent failure spinning the loop with no delay.
