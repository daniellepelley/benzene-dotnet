/// An <see cref="IMeshUsageSource"/> that reads the <c>benzene.messages.processed</c> counter back from
/// Azure Monitor / Application Insights and reports it as the mesh usage feed: a count per
/// (topic, transport, status) over a configured window. The counter is emitted by every service's
/// <c>UseBenzeneMetrics()</c> middleware (tags <c>topic</c>/<c>transport</c>/<c>result</c>) and exported to
/// Application Insights by the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry exporter, where it lands in the Log Analytics
/// <c>customMetrics</c> table; this source is the aggregator-side reader that turns those metrics into
/// <c>usage.json</c>. The Azure sibling of <c>Benzene.Mesh.Usage.CloudWatch</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// It reports the dimensions the metric carries (topic, transport, and the outcome as <c>status</c>) and
/// leaves the ones it can't (<c>version</c>, <c>service</c>, <c>avgDurationMs</c>) <c>null</c>, per the
/// missing-dimension rule. It assumes the counter is exported with <b>delta</b> temporality so a sum of
/// <c>valueSum</c> over the window equals the request count; a cumulative export would over-count. An empty
/// result is reported as an empty <see cref="MeshUsage.Entries"/> - "feed wired, no traffic observed" -
/// never <c>null</c>; a genuine query failure propagates (the aggregator bounds and skips a throwing source).
