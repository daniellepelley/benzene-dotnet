# Benzene.Clients.Aws.Sns

> **2026-07-25:** on an authorization failure the check names its missing action in
> `Data["RequiredPermission"]` (`sns:GetTopicAttributes`) — grant it alongside `sns:Publish` on the
> topic (the AwsMesh example Terraform does; per-check IAM table in `docs/health-checks.md`).


## What this package does
Outbound SNS client for a Benzene app: publish messages to an SNS topic. Pins **only**
`AWSSDK.SimpleNotificationService`.

## Key types
- `SnsBenzeneMessageClient` — `IBenzeneMessageClient`; publishes to a topic ARN. Both constructors
  fall back to `NullLogger<SnsBenzeneMessageClient>.Instance` when `logger` is null, so a null-logger
  construction can't make the `catch` block's own `LogError` call throw and mask the real publish
  failure (#192, a P8 sweep across all nine `Benzene.Clients.*` message clients).
- `SnsClientMiddleware` / `SnsSendMessageContext` — terminal publish middleware and its context.
- `SnsBatchMessageClient` — `IBenzeneBatchMessageClient` (from `Benzene.Clients`); publishes a
  collection via `PublishBatch` (≤10/call). Reuses `SnsContextConverter<T>` per entry (message +
  attributes + FIFO group/dedup ids), chunks with `BatchSend.Chunk`, and maps `response.Failed` back
  to caller indices in a `BatchSendResult` (entry `Id` = caller's request index). Covered by
  `test/Benzene.Core.Test/Clients/Aws/BatchMessageClientTest.cs`.
- `SnsContextConverter<T>` — `IBenzeneClientContext<T, Void>` → publish context.
- `OutboundSnsContextConverter` — the `Benzene.Clients.OutboundContext` counterpart, used by the
  `OutboundContext` overloads of `.UseSns(topicArn, …)` for `AddOutboundRouting(...).Route(topic, …)`.
- `Extensions` — `UseSnsClient`, `UseSns<T>` (the `IBenzeneClientContext<T,Void>` overloads) and
  `UseSns` (the `OutboundContext` overloads).
  - **Auto-wired health check (Phase 1, default-on).** The two default (DI-handle) `UseSns`/`UseSns<T>`
    overloads take `bool healthCheck = true`: unless opted out they auto-register a non-destructive
    `SnsHealthCheck` for the topic on the **dependency category** (`AddDependencyHealthCheck`, deduped by
    `"Sns:{topicArn}"`), reusing the `IAmazonSimpleNotificationService` from DI. Surfaces on the deep
    `healthcheck` layer only — never a liveness/readiness probe (a topic check is shared-fate; see
    `IDependencyHealthCheck`). The `action`-based overloads don't auto-wire — add `AddSnsHealthCheck`
    yourself there.

## Conventions
- `SnsContextConverter`/`OutboundSnsContextConverter` forward `IBenzeneClientRequest.Headers` onto
  SNS `MessageAttributes` (so correlation/trace decorators reach the wire) **and** set a `topic`
  message attribute — the same as SQS. The SNS *topic ARN* is the fan-out destination; the Benzene
  *topic* (which handler runs) is a separate routing key, and `Benzene.Aws.Lambda.Sns`'s
  `SnsMessageTopicGetter` reads it from this `topic` attribute. Omitting it (as this package used to)
  made a Benzene→Benzene SNS round-trip resolve to a null topic and fail to route. The attribute key
  is a configurable default (`topicAttributeKey` on the converters and `.UseSns(..., topicAttributeKey:)`),
  `SnsContextConverter<T>.DefaultTopicAttribute` = `"topic"` — keep it in sync with the consumer's key.
- **Empty attribute values are skipped.** SNS rejects a message attribute whose value is empty
  ("must contain non-empty message attribute value"), so both converters omit the `topic` attribute
  when `Request.Topic` is null/empty (the default `DefaultGetTopic` returns `string.Empty`, so a
  plain `SendAsync<T, Void>` with no explicit topic would otherwise emit `topic=""` and fail every
  publish) and skip any header whose value is empty. A real topic still routes as before; only the
  invalid empty case is dropped. Covered by `SnsContextConverterTest` (converter-level, no LocalStack).
- **FIFO + numeric filter typing (opt-in) — `SnsPublishOptions`.** Passed to `SnsContextConverter<T>` /
  `.UseSns<T>(..., publishOptions:)`: `MessageGroupIdHeader` → `PublishRequest.MessageGroupId` and
  `MessageDeduplicationIdHeader` → `MessageDeduplicationId` (both required/used by `.fifo` topics),
  and `InferNumericAttributeTypes` — when a forwarded header's value parses as a number, publish it
  with `DataType = "Number"` so numeric subscription filter policies match (default off, to avoid
  silently changing attribute types). Additive; covered by `SnsContextConverterTest`.
- Both outbound response mappers hardcode `IBenzeneResult<Void>` — SNS has only a publish
  acknowledgement, so a topic routed through SNS must be sent via `SendAsync<TRequest, Void>`; any
  other `TResponse` compiles but throws `Benzene.Clients.OutboundResponseTypeMismatchException` at
  runtime, naming the topic, the actual (`Void`) and requested response types (release plan Tier
  2.4 — this used to be a bare `InvalidCastException`; fixed in `DefaultBenzeneMessageSender`).
- **`SnsHealthCheck`** — verifies topic reachability with a read-only `GetTopicAttributes` call (the
  SNS analogue of `SqsHealthCheck`, but non-side-effecting: it does not publish). `Type => "Sns"`,
  dependency `("Topic", topicArn)`. Register via `AddSnsHealthCheck(topicArn)`; the consumer registers
  `IAmazonSimpleNotificationService` in DI (Benzene does not). Failures are classified through
  `HealthCheckError.Classify` (§3.9, reversed): an authorization/permission failure (403 — e.g. missing
  `sns:GetTopicAttributes`) is a **persistent `Failed`**, surfacing as unhealthy even for the auto-wired
  dependency check (a deterministic misconfiguration that won't self-heal; opt out with `healthCheck:
  false` where the read permission is legitimately absent), and the SDK's `ErrorCode`/`StatusCode` are
  surfaced in `Data` (never the exception message).
